The Queensland premier said he had received legal advice on the nuclear issue and raised the possibility of initiating a plebiscite on the same day as the federal election.  “Depending on how things play out, you could even hold that plebiscite on the same day as the federal election, to save people going to the polls twice,” Miles said in an exclusive interview with Guardian Australia. The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton,will take a planfor seven Commonwealth-owned nuclear power stations to the next election. That includes two in Queensland, replacing existing coal plants at Callide and Tarong. But an obscure provision in Queensland’s 17-year-oldNuclear Facilities Prohibition Act 2007may stand in the way. The act bans granting a grid connection, development application, or generating authority to any nuclear facility. It also requires the minister call a plebiscite if “satisfied the government of the commonwealth has taken, or is likely to, take any step supporting or allowing the construction of a prohibited nuclear facility in Queensland”. The opposition leader, David Crisafulli, has repeatedly ruled out changes to the law, most recentlyat a joint press conference with Duttonearlier this month. Miles said if Dutton won the federal election, whoever was Queensland premier would be required under law to hold a plebiscite. “The law of Queensland requires a plebiscite if it looks like the Australian government’s going to try to build a nuclear facility,” he said. “I’ve said that I’ll do everything I can to stand in the way of the most expensive option, that includes letting Queenslanders have their say. “Obviously, if I’ve won the election, they’ll have had their say, that will be a mandate for my position, which is for the cheaper option of storing renewables using pumped hydro. “But also the LNP leader claims he’s not going to change the law either, and so I assume that means he intends to hold a plebiscite as well. [It will] be interesting to see which side he campaigns on for that.” Queensland is the LNP’s strongest federal state. The LNP holds 21 of 30 lower house seats in Queensland, including the electorates of both the leader and deputy leader of the party. Election analyst Ben Raue said any state vote would increase the salience of the nuclear issue and could turn voters against the plan. “There’s a good chance it would affect people’s vote,” he said. “It could make people think about what’s the more important issues, but people are capable of voting in different ways. You know, when we have referendums, that doesn’t necessarily translate into how people vote at an election, but having them tied that closely together, happening at the same time, would do that.” Sign up toAfternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Miles said it was not an attempt to swing federal votes away from the LNP. “If they’re so confident of their plan, then why would it be?” he said. In June, Dutton said state governments “won’t stop us,” suggesting he wouldoverrule state legislation with federal laws. Miles has repeatedly vowed to defend the state’s nuclear ban in the high court. Asked last weekif the state had received legal advice about who would win a legal contest he said the state government’s ownership of the sites made a difference. “We’ve received advice on what steps we could take to strengthen our hand. Yes, we have,” he said. The Victorian and NSW parliaments passed bans on nuclear power in the 1980s, and the commonwealth parliament did so in 1999. Duttonhas yet to revealmany details of his plan, including the cost. The Guardian understands the state government had examined holding a plebiscite at the state election on 26 October. Queensland is legally permitted to hold referenda on any issue and stateshave called referendums at federal electionsin the past. In 1910, Queenslanders voted in a state referendum on religious education in schools plus a federal referendum, and a federal election, on the same day. Since 1922, states require approval by the governor general, who has only given it once: for the 1998 Northern Territory referendum on statehood. Queensland’s last referendum, held in 2016, required state elections to be held every four years on fixed dates. It was the third successful referendum in the state’s history, the first since 1910. The federal election must be held by May.",Andrew Messenger
headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/queensland-election-steven-miles-promises-free-primary-school-lunches,,Steven Miles bats away accusations of pinching policies from Greens ahead of Queensland polls opening | Queensland election 2024 | The Guardian,,"PremierSteven Mileshas warded off allegations of plagiarism from the Greens for a signature free school lunch policy announced at Sunday’s election campaign launch. The Labor leader promised a free lunch for everyQueenslandstate primary school student, the day before polls open in the state’s election. It came just a day after he unveiled a policy of state-owned, privately run GP clinics.  But in a rare consensus between theLiberal National partyand Greens, his political opponents agreed he had stolen the minor party’s lunch. Greens MP Amy McMahonintroduced a private members’ motion in 2021calling for the policy, which Labor voted down. Miles said there had been a change since 2021: “I’m premier.” The Labor left leader has spent months distancing himself from his predecessor, Annastacia Palaszczuk. She did not appear at Sunday’s campaign launch and has been rarely seen at party events since she stood down in December last year. “As I’ve said all along, as the premier, I will be doing what matters to Queensland and showing Queenslanders the kinds of things that I’m passionate about and I believe in, and school lunches has been a pretty consistent theme,” Miles said. “Queensland Labor, at the 11th hour, has decided to adopt the Greens plan to expand a free, universal school lunch program in every school,” federal Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather said on Sunday. “And if you want to make sure that we can deliver on this in the future, then you need a Greens MP”. Chandler-Mather claimed Labor had stolen a number of Greens policies, including50 cent fares, an electricity retailer and free school lunches, with the LNP also adopting some, including cheap fares. “Right now, they’re competing on who can announce more greens policies, which is great, and it demonstrates our power”. The deputy LNP leader, Jarrod Bleijie, also accused Miles of pinching from the Greens. “They have pinched a Greens policy that theLabor partyin parliament voted against not long ago,” he said. Under the policy, free healthy school lunches will be available for all state primary school students from prep to year 6. It would begin “next school year”, Miles said. The party argues the policy would save parents about $1,600 per child each year. Miles said long-term studies suggest that universal free school lunches lower social inequality, lift women’s participation in the workforce and help to prevent childhood obesity. An evaluation of similar programs showed a return on investment of 2.5 to seven times their cost, he said. “We all want kids to have the best start in life – and they learn best with full tummies,” Miles said. The policy is expected to cost about $1.4bn. The education announcement comes on the back of a major health pledge on Saturday. Miles on Saturday announced a $365m plan to build 50 new GP clinics, to be offered for use by private doctors, on condition they bulk-bill. Sign up toAfternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion On Sunday, Miles called it the “biggest intervention in primary care of any state or territory ever”. The school lunch program would cost the taxpayer about $1.4bn, according to Labor. With polls opening on Monday and last ballots cast on 26 October, Labor goes to the election well behind the LNP, according to opinion pollsters and the bookies. The party held its official campaign launch at North Lakes Community Centre, a stone’s throw from Miles’ outer suburban electorate. Miles entered to the Chappell Roan song Hot to Trot and exited to Bruce Springsteen’s We Take Care of Our Own, and stood before a gigantic sign reading “doing what matters for Queensland”. He was careful to wear a happy face for the party faithful on Sunday, again selling himself as a daggy suburban dad with a conscience. The premier even performed a live “lunchbox chat”, a staple of his social media, with daughter Bridie, to accompany the school lunch announcement. Journalists were also issued an illustrative lunchbox. But only a smattering of party grandees attended the launch, including party president, Queenslander Wayne Swan, and Peter Beattie, the longest-serving modern Labor premier. Miles refused to answer whether he was disappointed Palaszczuk had stayed away. “All of the former premiers were invited today. They’re all busy people with their own commitments,” he said, adding he was “happy either way”. A series of senior Labor ministers drew a contrast between what they said was a government of bold ideas aimed at the average Queenslander and an opposition running a small-target strategy. Miles took aim at Crisafulli’s recent abandonment of thestate’s legislated renewables strategy. He pointed to remarks by the federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, to argue the shift wasa stalking horse for nuclear power in the state. “Peter Dutton said it himself: the first step to a nuclear state is to elect Crisafulli. That means the first step to stoping nuclear is electing a Miles Labor government,” Miles said.",Andrew Messenger
headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/queensland-election-2024-lnp-abortion-policy-david-crisafulli,,Abortion wasn’t on the Queensland election agenda. So why is it now a threat to the LNP campaign? | Queensland election 2024 | The Guardian,,"On front doorsteps in Brisbane’s middle suburbs, Liberal National party candidates campaigning for the upcomingQueenslandelection have started getting questions about abortion. “It’s becoming an issue … in places we thought we might win,” says one party member.  Two weeks ago, as the Queensland election campaign began, Labor social media posts suggesting the LNP had a “secret plan” to limit abortion rights and access weredismissed as a scare campaign. The LNP leader,David Crisafulli, says his party has “ruled out” changes to Labor’s 2018 laws that decriminalised abortion. Abortion is, as Crisafulli says, “not a priority” for the LNP. But it has quickly become a problem. What might have started as a last-ditch Labor tactic has now become a mainstream issue, which LNP moderates say is damaging the party’s chances of regaining a footing in more progressive Brisbane electorates. This week the crossbench MP Robbie Katter pledged he would trigger a conscience vote to restrict – and possibly even criminalise – abortion. Crisafulli, whose ticket includes the former Christian right-backed senator Amanda Stoker and other MPs and candidates who are on record opposing abortion, has now been asked about the issue for five straight days. On Wednesday, he batted away 39 separate questions about the issue. Every question gets the same answer. The attempts to deflect are only adding fuel to the fire. Soon after Crisafulli became LNP leader in 2020, he struck a sort of informal stability deal with his party room to put internal fights to one side to bolster the LNP’s chances of taking back government. At the 2020 election, the LNP’s internecine bickering contributed to a weak result. Party members referred to unpopular office bearers – who tried to roll the leader, Deb Frecklington, just weeks before the campaign – as “the cabal”. The party’s identity crisis was writ large in an email from the then president, Cynthia Hardy, who said a review of the 2020 loss would seek to define what the LNP stood for. “What is our raison d’etre?” Hardy asked members. The four-year rebuild has now put the LNP in a position where, according to the polls, it is on the verge of winning government in Queensland. Sources say key to the success has been the informal stability arrangement – MPs from the moderates, conservatives and the Christian right all agreeing to drop their personal crusades and focus on a singular goal. The party found a unifying purpose: beating Labor. “But those divisions are still there, they haven’t gone away” one LNP source says. The shift in the campaign to focus on abortion rights, and the prospect of a conscience vote, serves to highlight those divisions in a way that can cause significant damage to the party, just weeks before voters go to the polls. The issue is so vexed for the LNP because it divides the party – the majority of its grassroots members, its platform and its MPs – from more progressive views of the electorate. Social reforms such as abortion and voluntary assisted dying have been key to Labor’s electoral success in Queensland, but particularly Brisbane where the LNP holds just four seats. Both of those reforms were progressed cautiously – drafted by the law reform commission and ultimately backed by polling that showed overwhelming support. And Labor has sought to exploit those sorts of social policy debates, knowing they harm the LNP in city areas where the party is eager to re-establish a presence. With the LNP cruising in the polls, moderates had held out hope of beating Labor in middle suburban seats – Ferny Grove, Stafford, Mansfield, Mount Ommaney and Aspley – areas beyond the reach of Greens insurgency, but still places where votes have more “small-l” liberal values. Many of these areas vote for the LNP at local and federal elections but are Labor strongholds in the state parliament. A Labor source says the reality is the state LNP is “way too wacko for Brisbane to stomach”. The added concern for LNP moderates is the potential makeup of the LNP party room after the election, if the party wins regional or city fringe seats but not Brisbane ones. “We need moderates in the next parliament,” one party member says. Party sources say the “Christian soldiers” grouping within the LNP has relatively little influence within the current state parliamentary team. There are really only two hardcore members of the Christian right in the LNP party room – the retiring rightwinger Mark Robinson and the veteran Sunshine Coast MP Fiona Simpson. Others often attributed as being associated with the faction, such as Tim Mander or Christian Rowan, are more neatly aligned with Peter Dutton’s mainstream conservative grouping. But before elections, factions always battle for influence. Robinson is handing his seat to Stoker, the former federal senator and figurehead of the Christian right. Candidates who have won preselection for winnable LNP seats include several who have ahistory of opposing abortion rights, or with links to Pentecostal churches. Particularly concerning to LNP moderates is the recent takeover of a large inner-city party division – and the attempted takeover of another – by the Christian right. The party’s Griffith federal divisional council – covering Queensland’s most progressive federal seat – is now helmed by Alan Baker, a veteran of anti-abortion campaigns in the state. Baker sent apre-election email on party letterheadsaying the government had been “captured by transgender ideology”. “Fringe infiltrators can see an election victory around the corner and are desperate to increase their influence,” an LNP source said at the time Baker won control of the branch. With polls still pointing to a comfortable LNP win, the risk for Crisafulli is that the prospect of a conscience vote – brought about by Katter – serves to highlight internal conflicts that have been paused, rather than solved. The opposition leader won’t say publicly whether he would allow a conscience vote, in line with party convention. The federal MP Colin Boycesaid it would be “extraordinary”not to. Crisafulli’s backers are mostly moderates, and MPs say the opposition has been “remarkably united” during the past term. But they also acknowledge that concern about abortion springs from “legitimate concern about what happens when we get in”. “It’s also difficult because we don’t have a track record to point back to,” the MP says. “We obviously try not to hark back to the Newman years.” In more than three decades, the conservatives have only won one Queensland election. After 2012, the landslide win by Campbell Newman, the LNP quickly became unstuck by factional warfare. The party’s MPs went to war with its organisational wing. The nature of the 2012 landslide also meant the election of new MPs who the party might not have expected to win. A state that voted for Newman, framed as a more moderate Liberal, wound up with a party room that veered more conservative and pushed that agenda in government. Griffith University political scientist and commentator Paul Williams says he expects those sorts of internal issues to come to the fore within 12 months of an LNP election win. “Those things are still there in the background,” he said. LNP figurespredicted Labor attacks about abortionwhen Stoker – who lost her Senate seat in 2022 – was preselected to run in Oodgeroo. Stoker announced herself to the public with a firebrand speech on the Senate floor, describing Queensland’s abortion decriminalisation laws as “barbarism [with] the cloak of civility”. In 2022, she told the Conservative Political Action Conference the Coalition would bein opposition for a “very long time”if it did not focus on conservative social issues. But since being announced as a candidate, Stoker has been uncharacteristically quiet as the LNP attempts to stifle intensifying debate about abortion and other social issues, and instead focus on kitchen-table ones. Her appearances on Sky News and rightwing podcasts and anti-abortion rallies have all been replaced with community breakfasts and visits to small businesses. Asked on Thursday whether she would support changes to Labor’s 2018 abortion laws, Stoker used the party line: “It’s not part of our plan, the LNP has ruled it out.” The LNP’s continued refusal to engage beyond its rehearsed line – that abortion reform is “not part of our plan” – now risks backfiring amid ramping pressure from different sides of the debate. At a pre-election meeting of a conservative Christian group last month, attenders were urged to email, call or speak to candidates and “just ask them the question: how would you vote if abortion came up”. “The fact you say that puts it in their mind that abortion is an election issue,” the forum moderator said. The LNP has not responded to the Australian Christian Lobby’s pre-election survey, which includes questions about abortion. The pro-choice service Children by Choice also sent questions to every state MP asking whether they supported, and would protect, ongoing access to termination of pregnancy.  have responded. “It feels ominous, it’s a scary position,” says Jill McKay, the chief executive officer of Children by Choice. “It’s a very simple question. “We’re not trying to polarise who people vote for, but it is a very deep concern that one of our major political parties is unable to present to Queensland what their policies are. “Women who vote for the LNP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the ALP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the Greens need to access abortion.” LNP sources acknowledge that the Katter plan to bring the issue to the next parliament “fucks us”. “[Crisafulli] needs to come out and say something more definitive,” one party source says. But another warns that sticking to the agreed lines remains the only tactic that could keep the informal stability arrangement in place. “The discipline that this whole campaign has been built on would dissolve in a second,” the source says.",Ben Smee
headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/01/queensland-state-election-labor-liberal-polls-steven-miles-david-crisafulli,,Five things you should know about the Queensland election | Queensland election 2024 | The Guardian,,"Queenslanders will go to the polls on 26 October. Here are five things you should know. It’s often said that Queensland is Australia’s most conservative state. But Labor has won 11 of the last 12 Queensland elections and has been in power in the sunshine state for almost a decade. Annastacia Palaszczuk won three elections and was an incredibly popular premier – especially during the first years of the pandemic – but voters had started to turn on Labor before Palaszczuk retired last year. The new premier, Steven Miles, has had just 10 months to turn things around. Labor hascut public transport fares, car registration fees and power bills. It has also taken risks, includingbacking out of plans to build new stadiums for the 2032 Olympics. A big question for Labor is whether voters who had turned on Palaszczuk will believe the government is now refreshed and under new management. Or if Labor’sgaudy signs promising discounts galorelook more like a “going out of business” sale. The opposition leader, David Crisafulli, has focused his campaign on law and order. He says there is a “youth crime crisis” in Queensland, even though the data suggestsjuvenile offending is at near-record lows. Regardless, media reporting and political debate have reached a point where the perception of a crisis – backed up by data or not – has taken hold. Comments to Guardian Australia by Steven Miles – that television news was“addicted to CCTV footage of crime”– have featured in LNP attack ads on social media. The conservative party is promising to introduce “adult time” for young people in the justice system, even though experts have warned the policy risks making matters worse. On almost everything else, the LNP has been vague about its plans, or simply tried to neutralise the issue by adopting Labor’s policies. Cheap public transport fares will stay. Crisafulli has even promised to honour Labor’s budget over the next four years. Labor has been critical of the LNP’s “small target” strategy. But at the same time Labor has tried the same tactic to try to neutralise anger about crime – adopting several of the LNP’s key policies over the last few years. Under Labor, Queensland locks up record numbers of children. Every poll since last year has shown the LNP is on track for a big win on 26 October. The opposition needs to win 12 seats for a majority, and most pollsters predict a swing to the LNP that would probably mean at least 20 seats – possibly more – are on track to change hands. There have been some positive signs for Labor, particularly in the Brisbane suburbs where 50c public transport fares are popular. But the biggest problem for the government is that Labor’s primary vote is low across the state. Even the most optimistic polls show Labor polling at or below 30% on primaries. Labor’s vote has only been that low once since the 1950s. And at that election, in 2012, the party won only seven seats. The Greens and Katter’s Australian party have both built strong footholds in Queensland. KAP has become the dominant conservative force in north Queensland. The party now holds four seats and will mount strong campaigns in two more. The Greens dominate the political landscape in large parts of inner Brisbane, where they hold three federal seats, two state seats and a couple of council wards. The party’s field campaigns now spread beyond progressive inner-city areas to middle suburbs where there are high numbers of renters. They are targeting potential wins in six seats. Elsewhere, One Nation always polls strongly in Queensland but experts say the party will struggle to win a seat. Pauline Hanson’s protege, James Ashby, is running for One Nation in the seat of Keppel. Queensland is mainland Australia’s most decentralised state, the only place where most people live outside the capital. There are some very conservative electorates and also some of the country’s most progressive pockets. Sometimes neighbouring seats swing in opposite directions. The“Queensland paradox”for major parties is navigating sometimes fraught issues – including crime and the climate crisis – from Townsville to Toowong and Mount Isa to Mount Ommaney, where voters often want different, contradictory things. Queenslanders also have a tendency to spray votes around from poll to poll. While Labor has dominated state politics for more than three decades, the Coalition has been the dominant force at federal elections. Labor has a stronghold in Brisbane, where the LNP holds just four seats. At council level, the LNP has held the lord mayoralty for more than 20 years. Ultimately, the election battle in the city will be about whether the LNP can win by a landslide, or whether Labor can save some of the furniture, including MPs viewed as potential future leaders, whose seats are under threat. The places that will determine who forms the next government are in the regions, where polls suggest anti-government sentiment has become baked in. Expect the leaders to spend plenty of time in Cairns and Townsville, especially early in the campaign.",Ben Smee
headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/oct/14/accidental-vet-email-further-evidence-of-euthanasia-of-healthy-greyhounds-in-victoria,2024-10-13,Accidental vet email further evidence of euthanasia of healthy greyhounds in Victoria | Greyhound racing | The Guardian,,"It was an accidental email that confirmed what many animal activists fear is a widespread issue in Victoria’s greyhound racing industry: young, healthy dogs being euthanised. In July, clinic notes from a vet intended for a greyhound trainer were mistakenly sent to a rehoming group that had recently been to the same vet for treatment of a rescue dog.  “They aren’t our usual vet. We had requested a record of vaccination so it was a real shock to see the word euthanasia pop up on the screen,” Elle Fisk from Greyt Greys Rescue told Guardian Australia. The notes, seen by Guardian Australia, show a trainer found their 12-month-old greyhound with a leg injury on their property. The vet suspected a fracture but the owner refused X-rays or treatment and instead requested euthanasia. “The thing that shocked us the most was not only the age of the dog, but the fact that the vet had stated the owner was not interested in treatment,” Fisk said. “Once these dogs aren’t making money, they are treated like rubbish and discarded.” The incident is not an isolated case. In September, the Victorian Racing Tribunal found a registered public trainer and breeder brought the industry into disrepute by having a dog unnecessarily euthanised in 2022. The tribunal heard the experienced trainer told a vet there was a lameness issue and repeatedly asked her to “just euthanise the dog”. They did not allow the greyhound to be medically examined before the procedure but the vet told the tribunal it “did not appear injured and there was no obvious fracture” and it was standing “OK on all four legs”. The tribunal determined the trainer made “no effort at all” to rehome the greyhound and deemed the euthanasia “unnecessary”. Penalty findings for the case are ongoing and have been requested in written form due to the trainer’s “aggressive outbursts” during the hearing. In another case from 2022, a different trainer was found by the tribunal to have euthanised nine dogs between 2016 and 2019 without any effort to rehome them and without notifying the body that oversees the industry, Greyhound Racing Victoria. Instead, the trainer misled the GRV by reporting the dogs as “retired pets”. “Each dog was euthanised … and it was always your intention that this would happen,” the tribunal’s finding reads. In New South Wales, similar concerns have also emerged, witha report by the greyhound racing peak body’s former chief vet Dr Alex Brittanalleging some vets in the industry willingly euthanise large numbers of greyhounds. The report, which has led to an independent inquiry, named two vets “responsible for half the euthanasia in NSW”. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The Victorian state Animal Justice party MP Georgie Purcell said there is no way to know how many healthy greyhounds are being euthanised in Victoria because GRV does not publish a breakdown of deaths. Its annual report has previously only included an overall figure for euthanasia as well as “racing fatalities” – deaths that occur instantaneously on the track. In the 2022-23 reporting period, GRV recorded 382 euthanasia deaths and 40 racing fatalities. “It’s really misleading to the public because euthanasia sounds like it was in the best interest of the dog,” Purcell said. “But we know there are dogs with treatable injuries that industry participants just want dead because they might not be economically viable any more.” In parliament on Wednesday, Purcell will move a motion that, if passed, would force GRV to report how many dogs are killed off-track and the specific reasons for that. The motion also proposes that any deaths occurring within 10 days of a race, training or trial be reclassified as racing fatalities. In response, GRV said its latest figures show racing fatalities in Victoria have decreased by 47% over the past five years. “Instances of euthanasia have also declined by nearly 40% … as a result of GRV’s dedication to ensuring all healthy retired greyhounds are rehomed as pets once their racing careers are over,” it said. Guardian Australia understands that GRV’s upcoming annual report, yet to be tabled in parliament, will include a breakdown of “euthanasia by reason” and non-euthanasia deaths. While there are no plans to reclassify racing fatalities, Guardian Australia understands GRV is open to introducing a separate category: “track-related mortality not as part of race meeting”, which is a classification used in NSW.",Benita Kolovos

Hunger inLebanoncould soar amid Israeli onslaught on the country, a leading UN expert has warned. The Guardian’s Nina Lakhani reports: Hunger and malnutrition rates could rise “exponentially” inLebanon, if Israel follows through with threats to escalate the current military operation which has so far killed more than 2,000 and displaced as many as a million people, according to a leading UN expert. “Israel has the ability to starve Lebanon – like it has starved Palestinians in Gaza,” said Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food. “If you look at the geography of Lebanon,Israelhas the power to absolutely put a stranglehold on the food system. There is a huge risk of hunger and malnutrition rates skyrocketing very quickly in Lebanon.” Acute hunger rates could rise very quickly because food security in Lebanon was precarious even before Israel launched its full-scale aerial bombardment in mid-September, as growing hostilities with Hezbollah since 7 October had already displaced 40% of local farmers, disrupting local production and interrupting trade flows and access to markets, according to the UNWorld Food Programme.

It is part of the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months, to support the defense of Israel and protect Americans from attacks by Iran and Iranian-aligned militias.” Sunday’s announcement marks the third THAAD system to be deployed to the region. Following Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel, Joe Biden authorised the deployment of a THAAD battery to the region. In 2019, the US deployed a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 for training and an integrated air defense exercise, the Pentagon said. Palestinian civilians and aid workers in the Gaza Strip say “no one is talking about” the bloodshed there and ceasefire hopes are receding as the world’s attention shifts toLebanon. The Guardian’s Bethan McKernan reports: As Israeli bombs began to fall acrossLebanon, the scenes of bloodshed and chaos were grimly familiar to the people of Gaza. Mai al-Afifa, 24, was teaching a workshop about how to identify unexploded ordnance in a school turned shelter in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday when an Israeli missile hit the next building in the compound. Twenty-eight people were killed and 54 injured, according to medics at the scene. Through the smoke and rubble dust Afifa saw the body parts of two women and a male aid worker as she stumbled to safety. The Israeli military said it had used a precise strike to target Hamas fighters using the school as a command centre. “We are very sad about what is happening now in Lebanon … We have experienced this pain and loss,” Afifa said. “But we also fear thatGazawill be forgotten: the massacres have increased here and no one is talking about it. All the TV channels are talking about the regional war, Iran, Israel and what is happening in Lebanon.” For the full story, click here: The US is planning to send an anti-missile system to Israel, the Wall Street Journal reports,citingUS officials. According to the outlet, the US is also planning to send “just under 100 troops in all” to operate the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system. The White House has not released an official statement yet. An Israeli airstrike killed five children in northern Gaza on Sunday, Reuters reports. Citing Palestinian news agency WAFA, Reuters reports that the children were playing near a cafe in the Al-Shati area when they were killed by a drone strike. Since last October, Israel has killed more than 16,400 children in Gaza, making the occupied Palestinian territory the deadliest place in the world for children,according toSave the Children. Former president Donald Trump, who is the Republican presidential candidate, said he spoke with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu “like two days ago”.

Israel’s military on Saturday ordered people in 23 southern Lebanese villages to evacuate to areas north of the Awali River, which flows from the western Bekaa valley into the Mediterranean.  The order, communicated via a military statement, mentioned villages in southernLebanonthat have been recent targets of Israeli attacks, many of which are already almost empty. The Israeli military also claimed on Saturday, without providing evidence, that Hezbollah militants were using ambulances to transport themselves and weapons and called on medical teams to “avoid dealing with Hezbollah operatives and not to cooperate with them”. In a post on X, the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) Arabic spokesperson threatened that it would target “any vehicle carrying armed men, regardless of its type”. The Lebanese health ministry said on X on Saturday that five hospitals had sustained damage from the Israeli airstrikes in the eastern city of Baalbek and the Bekaa valley. The Israeli military had no immediate comment, and it was not possible to independently verify the hospital strikes. The Guardian haspreviously reportedthat at least 50 paramedics have been killed since Israel launched its most recent attacks on Lebanon. All have belonged to healthcare services affiliated with either Hezbollah or Amal, another Shia political party – affiliations that rights experts say do not affect their protected status under international law. The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) last week was forced to close its clinic in a southern suburb of Beirut and temporarily stop its activities in another one in the north, because of heavy airstrikes, the group said in a statement on Thursday. A UN report last weekaccused Israel of pursuing a concerted policy of destroying Gaza’s healthcare systemin the war in the strip, including “relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities”, saying this constituted war crimes and extermination as a crime against humanity. Israel, which accuses the UN of institutional bias against it and claims Hamas hides in healthcare facilities, rejected the findings. At least 15 people were killed and 37 wounded in Israeli strikes across three different areas in Lebanon, the Lebanese health ministry said on Saturday. One of the targeted locations was in the town of Deir Billa in northern Lebanon, which had not been struck before. A marketplace in the southern city of Nabatieh was also targeted. Nine people were killed and 15 injured in the village of Maaysra, a mostly Christian mountain area north of Beirut, while four were killed and 18 injured in Barja in the Shouf district south of the capital, the ministry said. In Deir Billa, the ministry reported two dead, four wounded and “body parts” after an Israeli strike. DNA tests were being carried out to determine the identity of the remains, the statement added. Lebanon’s official National News Agency had said an “Israeli strike” targeted a house in the village where families from south Lebanon had taken refuge. The Israeli military, meanwhile, said Hezbollah had fired nearly 320 projectiles from Lebanon into Israel on Saturday, without giving further details. It declared areas around some towns in north Israel closed to the public. Another member of Unifil, the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, was struck by gunfire on Friday, the organisation said on Saturday, adding that the man was stable after undergoing surgery to remove the bullet. The statement also said Unifil’s position in the southern Lebanese town of Ramyah sustained significant damage as a result of explosions after nearby shelling, but did not specify who was responsible for either attack. A total of fiveUN peacekeepers were injured on Thursday and Friday when the Israeli militaryfired on the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping missionin southern Lebanon on three occasions, drawing condemnations from the global body and various countries. Unifil has accused Israel of deliberately targeting its positions. A group of 40 countries participating in the Unifil mission issued a joint statement on Saturday condemning the recent attacks on the peacekeepers’ base and calling for all parties to ensure their safety. “Such actions must stop immediately and should be adequately investigated,” said the joint statement, posted on X by the Polish UN mission and signed by countries including leading contributors Indonesia, Italy and India. The Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, said his government would ask the UN security council to issue a new resolution calling for a “full and immediate ceasefire”. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, in a call on Saturday with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, expressed “deep concern” about reports that Israeli forces had fired on UN peacekeeping positions in recent days and urged Israel to ensure safety for them and the Lebanese military, the Pentagon said. Austin also “reinforced the need to pivot from military operations in Lebanon to a diplomatic pathway as soon as feasible”, according to the Pentagon statement. Hezbollah said it had attacked the outskirts of Tel Aviv with a swarm of drones on Friday, without giving further details. Israel said there were no casualties reported when its military detected and intercepted two drones from Lebanon. The Israeli military claimed it had hit about 200 targets in Lebanon with artillery and airstrikes and killed about 50 Hezbollah fighters and dismantled dozens of weapons storage sites. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants erupted one year ago when the Iranian-backed group began launching rockets at northern Israel in support of Hamas on 8 October, at the start of the war in Gaza. It has intensified in recent weeks, with Israel bombing southern Lebanon, Beirut’s southern suburbs and the Bekaa valley, killing many of Hezbollah’s leaders, and sending ground troops across the border. Hezbollah, for its part, has fired rockets deeper into Israel. The Israeli campaign has forced approximately 1.2 million people from their homes since 23 September, according to the Lebanese government. Israel says its Lebanon offensive aims to secure the return home of tens of thousands of people who evacuated from northern Israel because of Hezbollah rocket fire. As of Friday the death toll had reached 2,255 since the beginning of hostilities, the Lebanese health ministry said on Saturday. TheUnited NationsOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Saturday that more Lebanese people had been displaced than during the last major war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, when about 1 million fled their homes.

headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/unifil-israeli-tanks-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-iran,,UN mission says Israeli tanks forcibly entered base in southern Lebanon | Lebanon | The Guardian,,"The UN peacekeeping mission inLebanonhas said two Israeli tanks destroyed a gate and forcibly entered a base in the south of the country as Israel’s ground operation against Hezbollah moved deeper into Lebanese territory. The incident in Ramyah on Sunday morning was the latest in a string of violations that Unifil, the UN force deployed since 1978 to southern Lebanon, has blamed on theIsraelDefense Forces (IDF).  After the tanks left, shells exploded about 100 metres from the base, and the ensuing smoke left 15 staffers needing medical treatment for unusual symptoms despite the use of gas masks. Unifil also accused the Israeli military of holding up a logistics convoy. In a statement released late on Sunday, the Israeli military said a Merkava tank had been trying to evacuate injured soldiers and had backed into the Unifil post accidentally. Five peacekeepers have been injured since Friday as Israeli ground troops have begun to advance farther north in Lebanon after two weeks of intense fighting and airstrikes. The death toll in the small Mediterranean country now stands at more than 1,400 since late September, after intense Israeli airstrikes overnight on the centre of the southern city of Nabatieh. Unifil said it had requested an explanation from the IDF for what it called “shocking violations”. In a videoed statement addressed to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Sunday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterated Israeli calls for Unifil troops to evacuate. “The time has come for you to withdraw Unifil from Hezbollah strongholds and from the combat zones,” he said. “The IDF has requested this repeatedly and has met with repeated refusal, which has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields.” He later said on X: “Israel will make every effort to prevent Unifil casualties and will do what it takes to win the war.” Israel argues that Unifil has failed in its mission to uphold a UN resolution from two decades ago that was supposed to ensure that Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-allied Lebanese militia, withdrew from the border area. In the three weeks since a year of tit-for-tat cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah escalated into all-out war, the 10,000-strong Unifil force from 50 different countries has refused to leave 29 positions across southern Lebanon, citing the same UN resolution, which ensures freedom of movement for its staff. Israeli forces have repeatedly fired on medics and first responders as well as Unifil peacekeepers since Israel invaded Lebanon on 1 October, amidgrowing international opprobrium. Hezbollah had begun firing on Israel the day after Hamas’s 7 October attack that triggered the new war, ostensibly in solidarity with the Palestinian group. The IDF accuses Hezbollah of using ambulances to carry fighters and weapons and says Hezbollah operates in the vicinity of the peacekeepers, but has not provided evidence. Unifil’s spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told Agence France-Presse on Saturday: “There was a unanimous decision to stay because it’s important for the UN flag to still fly high in this region, and to be able to report to the security council.” Relations between Israel and the UN, frosty for decades, have reached a nadir since the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023. In territory under its control, Israel is attempting to close down Unrwa, the world body’s agency for Palestinian refugees, accusing it of routinely employing Hamas operatives. The UN fired nine staff members implicated in the 7 October attack but an investigation stressed that Israel had not provided evidence for its main allegations. Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, reiterated on Sunday that Guterres was barred from entering the country due to what Katz described as “antisemitic and anti-Israel conduct”. Elsewhere in Lebanon, at least three people were killed and dozens wounded in Israeli airstrikes overnight in which mosques and residential buildings were targeted, after strikes on several villages on Saturday killed 15. The IDF said it had hit 200 Hezbollah sites over the past 24 hours. Hezbollah responded with rocket barrages fired across northern and central Israel on Sunday, most of which were intercepted by Israel’s air defence systems. Three people were critically injured and five seriously injured in a drone strike near Binyamina on Sunday night. Also over the weekend, Israel ordered residents of another 23 villages across southern Lebanon to evacuate north. About 1.2 million people – a quarter of the population – have been driven from their homes since fighting escalated three weeks ago when Israel killed much of Hezbollah’s leadership in airstrikes, including its secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli evacuation directives now cover a quarter of the country. In the Gaza Strip, fierce fighting in the Jabaliya area of Gaza City that the UN estimates has left 400,000 peopletrapped with dwindling water and food suppliesentered a second week. The World Food Programme, the UN food agency, reported on Saturday that no food aid had reached northern Gaza since 1 October, raising new fears of famine and extreme hunger. An Israeli strike on the central town of Deir al-Balah on Sunday killed a family of eight, local medics said. The region is still bracing for an anticipated Israeli response to an unprecedented missile attack by Iran two weeks ago, launched in support of its Lebanese ally after Israel’s ground invasion. NBC reported on Saturday that US officials believed Israel had narrowed down targets to military and energy infrastructure. Miscalculation could propel Iran and Israel into a full-scale war. The US, Israel’s staunch ally, iswary of being drawn into the fightingand of negative impacts on the global oil industry. In a social media post, Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said on Sunday there were “no red lines” for Tehran on the issue of defending itself, and indirectly threatened US forces against operating in Israel. “The US has been delivering record amount of arms to Israel,” he said on X. “It is now also putting lives of its troops at risk by deploying them to operate US missile systems in Israel. “While we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests.” Later on Sunday, the Pentagon confirmed that the US would send a sophisticated anti-missile system known as Thaad and operator troops to Israel to protect from missile attacks such as those launched against the Jewish state by Iran in April and September.",Bethan McKernan

All the TV channels are talking about the regional war, Iran, Israel and what is happening in Lebanon.” Israel launched a ground invasion of Lebanon at the beginning of October after two weeks of heavy airstrikes and targeted assassinations aimed at destroying Hezbollah’s leadership and military capabilities. Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-allied Lebanese militia, had begun firing on Israel the day after Hamas’s 7 October attack that triggered the new war, ostensibly in solidarity with the Palestinian group. Tit-for-tat cross-border fire over the last year has displaced hundreds of thousands of people on both sides of the blue line from their homes. Israel says its “targeted and limited” offensive in Lebanon is aimed at allowing Israeli civilians to return to evacuated areas. But a fifth of the country has already been displaced by Israeli evacuation orders that now cover a quarter of the small Mediterranean country, raising fears that Israel is preparing for a much wider push against the Lebanese group. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, told the Lebanese people in a televised speechlast weekto “free your country from Hezbollah” in order to avoid “destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza”. The war in Lebanon and the threat of a region-wide escalation drawing in Iran and the US has pushed Gaza down news bulletins and the diplomatic agenda. Even so, Israel has managed to renew its year-long offensive on the besieged Palestinian territory. An estimated 400,000 people are trapped by the latest fighting in the Jabaliya neighbourhood of Gaza City, which has now entered a second week. Israel claims the ground offensive is necessary to prevent Hamas from regrouping. Badr Alzaharna, 25, from Gaza City, said he and his family wanted to leave after clinging on in their home for a year, but the fighting and Israeli snipers made it impossible. “Just walking in the street you see apocalyptic scenes … It is traumatising to be here. [Every day] I am reminded of the hypocrisy of the world,” he said. The entirety of north Gaza is under Israeli evacuation orders: the Israeli army has told civilians to move to al-Mawasi, a coastal area in southern Gaza, for their safety, although it has also bombed the “humanitarian zone” several times. The World Health Organization said last week that seven missions to evacuate wounded people from struggling hospitals and take them south had been denied or impeded by Israeli forces. A year on since the 7 October Hamas attack that triggered the war in Gaza, one in every 55 people has been killed, more than 90% of the 2.3 million-strong population have been displaced from their homes, and food, medicine and clean water are still in scarce supply amid new Israeli restrictions on what can enter the strip. In September, UN and Israeli government data shows, deliveries of food and aid to Gazafell to the lowest in seven monthsdue to new rules imposed by Israel, leading the UN World Food Programme to warn that the threat of famine still loomed. Northern Gaza has had no food deliveries since 1 October. The UN body said on Saturday it had distributed the last of its supplies of high-energy biscuits, tinned food and flour, and it was unclear how long it would last. Rohan Talbot, the director of advocacy and campaigns for the UK-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said: “We are running out of words to describe the horrors we are hearing from northern Gaza. Israel’s bombardment is relentless, terrified and starving people have been gunned down as they try to flee, and dozens of bodies are lying in the street. While Israel’s war on Palestinian survival escalates, the international community appears to have given up on Gaza. All momentum towards a ceasefire has stalled.” Internationally mediated talks aimed at a lasting ceasefire and a hostage release deal have been deadlocked since July, driving Palestinians and the families of Israeli captives seized on 7 October to despair. Those negotiations are now overshadowed by efforts to calm the situation in Lebanon and prevent an all-out war between Israel and Iran, after Tehran attacked the Jewish state with 180 ballistic missiles earlier this month in response to the assassinations of Hezbollah’s leader,Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut and the Hamas leader,Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran. Until last month, a ceasefire in Gaza was seen as key to ending the escalating regional tensions: Iran, Hezbollah and other allied militias in Yemen, Iraq and Syria all maintained they would stop firing on Israel and US assets around the Middle East when the war in Gaza ends. But after Israel’s declaration of war on Hezbollah, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed in a speech that Tehran and its proxies would keep up the fight against Israel. Gaza’s future is no longer clearly linked to the other fronts of the war. Mohammed Said, 36, a father of four from Deir al-Balah now sheltering with his family elsewhere in the city after their home was damaged in an airstrike, said he was resigned to the fact that the world’s attention had shifted elsewhere. “Gaza was always forgotten. That’s why all of this has happened,” he said.",Bethan McKernan

headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/14/indigneous-voice-to-parliament-referendum-anniversary-advocates-call-for-unity,2024-10-13,Indigenous voice champions mark referendum anniversary with rallying cry for unity in Australia | Indigenous voice to parliament | The Guardian,,"A key proponent of theIndigenous voice to parliament,rejected at a referendum a year ago, has challenged Australians to be “bigger and wider – to be grand” and to forge from that bruising experience “an authentic Australian nation”. Pat Anderson’s rallying cry on the eve of the anniversary came at the close of an hour-long online event for key yes advocates to reflect, lament and commit to “stay true to Uluru”.  “There’s a real opportunity here to actually turn Australia into an authentic Australian nation,” Anderson told the online audience, “with people who are proud and respectful and acknowledge each other, and can go forward with all the energy that we have in this country and all the resources that this wonderful country has to offer to us.” Anderson, an Alyawarre woman, joined other participants inthe 2017 Uluru dialoguesin reflecting on the process that had created the Uluru statement from the heart and its three ambitions – voice, treaty and truth – and then the brutal defeat of last year’s attempt to realise the first. Anderson lamented that Australia still couldn’t “have the hard conversations”. She said the Uluru statement was “a guide, a roadmap to how we can all move forward as a sophisticated nation”. “The Uluru statement from the heart was a gift of love,” she said. “It was a gift of hope. It was a gift of asking you to join us. And the most of you rejected it. “But we’re not going to stop, because this is our place. And as I said, we ain’t going anywhere.” She saidIndigenous Australianswould keep inviting the rest of the nation “asking you, begging you almost, to see our point of view, to respect us, to acknowledge us”. Participants in the event thanked the 6.2 million Australians – the 40% of the population – who voted yes and emphasised that 80% of Indigenous Australians were among them. “This is a really quite emotional time for us,” Anderson said. “And I just wanted to take the opportunity to ask us to think bigger and wider and to be grand and to be fantastic. We have all the resources to do it. So let’s grab it and do it anyhow.” The youth dialogues co-chair and Cobble Cobble woman Allira Davis became emotional praising the elders who led the campaign. “As young people, we had the best leaders to lead the way forward and keep leading the way forward until we are given the torch to fight the good fight,” she said. “And that’s what we’re going to do.” Anderson spoke of Indigenous mothers who warned their children that if they encountered police, they should be polite, answer the questions and not make trouble. It was, she said “abhorrent racism”, which put them at risk just for being Aboriginal. “We tell our kids, especially our boys, the same message every Friday night, every time they go out,” she said. “And this has to stop.” She called for structural reform so Indigenous people could move forward. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “So we are not at the arse end of society, that we can take our proper place, that we are not excluded, that we can contribute to the nation in a way that we already do but it seems to be unrecognised.” The dialogues co-chair and Cobble Cobble womanProf Megan Davissaid that with greater public education about misinformation, Australians were beginning to understand “we didn’t get a fair go last year”. “Mainstream politics is now moving to protect itself,” Davis said. “But we were exposed to a lot of political lies and misinformation that scuttled our people’s attempt to finally do what wasn’t done in 1788, 1901 and 1967,” she said. “And so we’re still here.” Davis said that since the time of colonisation there still had been “no settlement to the original grievance”. “That’s never happened,and that’s what we’re still fighting for.” The dialogues elder and Wiradjuri man Geoff Scott said while the referendum question was ultimately rejected, the process of talking about the proposal around the country had been positive. “It was about unity,” Scott said. “It wasn’t about division. It was about a real way forward and understanding why we wanted to do it. And it’s for our kids, for the children, it’s for the elders, but it’s also about for the whole nation, about bringing us together.” Anderson was the last of the speakers, some of whom said the online gathering was held on the anniversary’s eve to give some Indigenous leaders space on the day itself.

He repeated this claim at a rally on Friday. Aurora’s mayor, Mike Coffman, said Trump’s claims are “grossly exaggerated”. “Well, Martha, you just said the mayor said they were exaggerated. That means there’s got to be some element of truth here,” JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, said during an interview on ABC’s This Week. “Unfortunately, when you let people in by the millions, most of whom are unvetted, most of whom you don’t know who they really are, you’re going to have problems like this,” Vance added. Michigan governorGretchen Whitmerhas apologized for feeding a Doritos chip to a social media influencer who dropped to her knees after Roman Catholic organizations accused the Democratic politician of insulting their religion by mocking the sacrament of communion. “I would never do something to denigrate someone’s faith,” Whitmer said in a statement that her office provided to the Michigan television news stationWJBKon Friday. She explained that the stunt in question – captured onvideowith popular TikTok content creatorLiz Plank– was meant to promote legislation signed by Joe Biden in 2022 that is colloquially known as the Chips Act and provided $280bn to research as well as manufacture semiconductors. But it was all “construed as something it was never intended to be, and I apologize for that”, Whitmer said. On the video, Plank genuflects before Whitmer, who then places a Doritos chip in the podcaster and influencer’s mouth. The governor caps the scene off by gazing at the camera while she wears a hat supporting fellow DemocratKamala Harrisand her running mate Tim Walz in November’s presidential election. The Michigan Catholic Conference – which hasclashedwith Whitmer over her support of abortion rights – joined other church groups in condemning Whitmer’s video with Plank. More on the controversial video here:  Updated at20.07 BST Donald Trump called those who have opposed or investigated him “the enemy from within”. “I always say, we have two enemies,” Trump said in an interview on Fox Business’s Sunday Morning Futures. “We have the outside enemy, and then we have the enemy from within, and the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia and all these countries.” He said that what a president might find hard to handle “are these lunatics that we have inside, likeAdam Schiff” referring to the California congressman and US Senate candidate who was part of a House committee that investigated the US Capitol attack carried out by Trump’s supporters after he lost the 2020 election to Biden.  Updated at19.56 BST Tension betweenKamala Harris’s team andJoe Biden’s White House has been on the rise in the last weeks before the elections,Axiosreported. Senior Biden aides told the news outlet that they’re still hurt over the president being pushed out of his re-election bid. Biden’s aides said they’re adjustingto being in a supporting role on the campaign trail. “They’re too much in their feelings,” one Harris ally said of Biden’s team.  Updated at19.22 BST Former PresidentBill Clintonvisited Albany, Georgia, at an event for the Harris-Walz campaign. Clinton arrived at Mount Zion Baptist church and delivered remarks during the Sunday service. “Experts in both parties say that this election is coming down to seven or eight states, one of which is Georgia,” Clinton said. “This whole election and the future of the country is turning out to be what people who are sort of on the fence about voting are going to do in the next three and a half weeks.” Early voting in the state starts on Tuesday and will run over the next three weeks.  Updated at19.06 BST Kamala Harrispaid a visit to North Carolina, holding a rally in Greenville at East Carolina University a day after her stop in Raleigh. Over the weekend, she has been meeting with faith leaders and volunteering to help prep supplies forHurricane Helenevictims, which ravaged western North Carolina a few weeks ago. “I know Helene’s impact was further west, but I also know that the people of Greenville, like all Americans, have been inspired by the way communities are coming together,” Harris said on Sunday at theKoinonia Christian Center in Greenville. “In a moment of crisis, isn’t it something when you know that often it is the people who have the least give the most,” she said.  Updated at18.52 BST Republican representativeLiz Cheneycriticized House speakerMike Johnsonfor saying there was a peaceful transfer of power to Joe Biden afterDonald Trumplost in 2020. “I do not have confidence that Mike Johnson will fulfill his constitutional obligations,” Cheney said. “He has a record repeatedly of doing things that he knows to be wrong, that he knows to be unconstitutional, in order to placate Donald Trump. You saw that sycophancy just now.” Earlier in the show, Johson said: “We have the peaceful transfer of power.” “I believe President Trump’s going to win, and this will be taken care of,” he added.  Updated at18.38 BST Kamala HarrisandDonald Trumpspent Sunday trying to shore up political support among what they perceived to be must-have voting blocs with polls showing them locked in a tight 5 November presidential race. With election day less than a month away, the Democratic vice-president attended a Black church in Greenville, North Carolina, as part of her campaign’s “souls to the polls” push. Her Republican opponent was in Arizona, looking for Black and Latino support as he seeks a second presidency, after a rally in California a day earlier. Both candidates are attempting to get a decisive edge among votes who have not yet decided who to support. Surveys show that early voting, which tends to favor Democrats, is down 45% from previous election years – a sign that there may be millions of undecided voters. Trump has now switched from condemning early voting as a Democrat plot to engineer his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020 to urging people to vote early and by mail. A recent ABC News-Ipsospollshowed that support was split down gender lines, with women voting 60-40 to Harris and men breaking for Trump by a similar margin. Trump needs white women, who supported him in a greater numbers in 2020 than in 2016 – but also Black men. On Sunday, he argued that his fellow former president Barack Obama’s call last week for Black men to support Harris based “solely on her skin color, rather than her policies” as “deeply insulting”. Here’s more on the candidates’ campaign events:  Updated at18.24 BST Ramon Antonio Vargas Donald Trumpon Sunday said he does not expect chaos from his supporters on the day of the 5 November election. Asked on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures if he anticipated chaos from those who support him overKamala Harris, the former president said: “No, I don’t think. Not from the side that votes for Trump.” Supporters of Trump aimed a deadly attack on Congress weeks after he lost the presidency toJoe Bidenin 2020. The US Capitol attack – launched after he told his supporters to fight like hell – was a desperate attempt to prevent congressional certification of the US president’s victory. Hundreds of participants have been indicted on federal crimes pertaining to the violence. And Trump himself was criminally charged with illicitly trying to overturn his 2020 defeat in the lead-up to the attack, including by lying about how fraudsters robbed him of winning against Biden.  Updated at20.07 BST Homeland security secretaryAlejandro Mayorkason Sunday said the slew of misinformation online about the hurricanes devastating parts of the US is “extremely pernicious”. During an interview with Face the Nation, Mayorkas called for officials to debunk the false claims because “we’re not seeing enough of that.”  Updated at17.41 BST TheDemocratic National Committeereleased a six-figure ad campaign in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania calling outJill Steinas a “vote for Trump”. The ad opens with a photo of Stein morphing into the Republican presidential nominee. “Why are Trump’s close allies helping her? Stein was key to Trump’s 2016 wins in battleground states,” says the ad. “She’s not sorry she helped Trump win. That’s why a vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump.” Democratic party chairJaime Harrison, California Senate candidateAdam Schiff, activistJessica Craven, and others reacted to the ad on social.  Updated at18.12 BST Media blitz to VP duties: on the campaign trail with Kamala Harris The View, America’s most popular daytime talkshow, was on commercial break. Kamala Harrissat writing absence notesfor students who were missing class to attend the live broadcast. “Is it just today, right?” the vice-president laughed. She handed over the letters written on notepaper headed “The Vice President”. One said: “Dear teacher, please excuse Dani from class today. She was hanging out with us. Best and thank you for being an educator. Kamala.” It was an unscripted moment that the studio audience loved but TV viewers wouldn’t see. Harris, running the shortest presidential campaign in modern US history after being unexpectedly plunged into the fight when Joe Biden dropped out, is exploring ways to reveal herself to a wary nation. Still a relatively unknown quantity, the former California attorney general and US senator is trying to make the electorate feel comfortable about the prospect of PresidentKamala Harris. In less than three months the vice-president has raiseda record-breaking billion dollars. She has tried to put daylight between herself and the unpopular incumbent figure of Biden, andturn the election into a referendumon her opponent, former US president Donald Trump. She has sought to bring positive vibes to a country that seems to have anxiety in its bones. She has set out to persuade America to do something that it has never done before in its 248-year existence: elect a woman to the White House – and a woman of colour to boot. Here’s more on Harris’s media blitz: Republican’s lies about immigrants eating cats in Ohio has led to swell of far-right extremism in Springfield – and beyond For Denise Williams, the 70-year-old head of Springfield’s NAACP chapter, the past several weeks have been testing to say the least. Last month,flyerscalling for mass deportations of immigrants were distributed by the so-called Trinity White Knights, a group associated with the Ku Klux Klan, in Black-majority neighborhoods in south Springfield. “I’m telling people: do nothing – don’t approach them. But it’s not easy for people to see this,” she said. “I think that is what a lot of folks cannot understand – why do we have so much hate?” About 22% of Springfield residents are African American,according to the US Census Bureau. “People are mad. African Americans here don’t understand how this is allowed. We just have to take this for a minute. I know it’s hard.” Trinity White Knights is headquartered in Kentucky,whereflyers were also seen by residents of the Cincinnati suburb of Covington in July as part of an apparent recruitment effort. The flyers included a PO box address in Maysville, Kentucky, and a phone number. Ever since Donald Trump claimed during a 10 September televised debate watched by 67 million people that immigrants in Springfield were eating people’s pets – a claim that has beenfound to be baseless– Springfield has seen a groundswell in far-right extremism. Here’s more context on the rise in far-right extremism: Three major polls were released Sunday, showing Vice-PresidentKamala Harriseither ahead of former president Donald Trump or running a head-to-head race. Let’s start with theABC News/Ipsos poll: Harris is ahead by two percentage points with 50% of the support. The poll, conducted between 4 to 8 October, found that 56% of Americans favor deporting all undocumented immigrants, helping Trump’s lead in trust to handle immigration at the US-Mexico border. Meanwhile,NBC’s poll, conducted during the same time, shows Harris with support from 48% of registered voters, while Trump has the same percentage of support. Another 4% say they are undecided or wouldn’t vote for either option. CBS also conducted apollearlier this month, revealing a lead by Harris with 51% support compared to Trump’s 48%. The economy and policy surrounding the US-Mexico border are among the top issues voters are placing as top priorities when deciding on the next president.  Updated at18.06 BST Speaker Mike Johnsonsaid that passing additional hurricane aid for states impacted by hurricanesHeleneandMilton“can wait” until Congress is back in session after the election. On Sunday, Johnson CBS’s Face the Nation, where host Margaret Brennan asked him why he thinks it’s fine to wait until November for Congress to pass more aid for Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton victims. “Well, it can wait because, remember, the day before Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida and then went up through the states and wound up inSenator Tillis’sstate of North Carolina, Congress appropriated 20 billion additional dollars to FEMA so that they would have the necessary resources to address immediate needs,” Johnson said. Tillis was part of a bipartisan group of senators that signed a letter urging lawmakers to think about bringing Congress members back into session this month to pass disaster legislation before the year’s end.  Updated at18.05 BST Democraticsenator Raphael Warnock from Georgia said he does not believe Black men will show up for former President Trump in large numbers. During CNN’s State of the Union with Dana Bash, Warnock said: Black men are not going to vote for Donald Trump in any significant numbers. There will be some. We’re not a monolith. He was responding to a New York Timespollingthat placed Kamala Harris behind Joe Biden among Black voters. Warnock alluded to the late 80s case of theCentral Park Five, where the brutal assault of a New York jogger in Central Park led to Trump taking out full-page ads in the city’s major newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty for those responsible. “When it was proven that the Exonerated 5, the Central Park 5, were actually innocent,Donald Trumphas shown no deal of concern about what they went through, no deal, no bit of contrition about it,” Warnock said.  Updated at18.03 BST Good morning,US politicsblog readers. There’s another busy news day ahead of us and we’ll keep up with all the developments as they happen. Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, later today. Kamala Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, will head to a Get Out the Jewish Vote campaign event in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. He will later deliver remarks at aGirl Dads for Harris-Walzphone bank in Delaware County. Several polls released on Sunday show Vice-President Kamala Harris in the lead or in a tight race with former president Donald Trump. AnABC News/Ipsos pollshows 50% support for Harris and 48% for Trump, while the latest nationalNBC News pollshows Trump and Harris are deadlocked. Here’s what else is happening: Kamala Harrison Saturdayreleased a reporton her health and medical history, which found that “she possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency” if voters elect her in November. A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president’s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions aboutDonald Trump’s physical fitness and mental acuity. Tighteningpoll figureshave triggered nervousness and anxiety in Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, with Donald Trump making gains in the states where it matters most as the election race enters its climactic final phase, according to The Guardian’s 10-day polling average tracker. Several former Trump administration officials have warned that the former presidentdeliberately withheld disaster aidto states he deemed politically hostile to him as US president and will do so again unimpeded if he returns to the White House.",Coral Murphy Marcos
headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/14/business-council-blames-slow-local-decision-making-for-feeding-australias-housing-supply-crisis,2024-10-13,Business Council blames slow local decision-making for feeding Australia’s housing supply crisis | Housing | The Guardian,,"Local councils would be forced to set deadlines for deciding on housing development applications and lose approval rights if they cannot stick to them, under a proposal from the national peak body representing big business. TheBusinessCouncil of Australia (BCA) is urging state governments to force local councils to consult housing development proponents and set agreed deadlines, case by case, for ruling on their applications – then be held accountable for meeting them.  The BCA argued that delays in deciding on applications have created a supply bottleneck, fuelling uncertainty and making developers reluctant to invest. The BCA chief executive, Bran Black, said while government measures were being proposed on the demand side to help would-be buyers and renters, there was a housing supply crisis that was not being addressed. “We need to turbocharge the assessment and approval process so we get more homes built faster,” Black said. “Plain and simple, we need more supply and we want to work with local and state government to speed up their housing decisions, so builders can get on with the job of delivering places for people to live.” He pointed to the New South Wales government’s online “council report card” – which reveals the time each council has taken to resolve applications, whether they are approved or rejected – saying it could form a template for other states. Ahead of its report this week on housing supply and affordability, the BCA also proposed a new regime to set statutory deadlines where it said none currently exist. Under the proposal, local councils would be required to set a bespoke deadline for resolving each application. If they failed to meet it, the decision would default to the state government. Councils which persistently failed to meet their agreed decision-making deadlines would have their approval powers revoked and transferred to the state government. Sign up toAfternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Black acknowledged the changes would be hard to implement but said action was required. “I hear from members that some councils are highly professional while others are unresponsive and can take months to make a decision, in some cases running down the clock because they can,” Black said. He said state governments should also have the power to assess and approve proposed projects that are deemed to be of “state significance”. Each state currently sets its own threshold for determining what qualifies, ranging from a $20m project value for metropolitan developments in Western Australia to $75m in Sydney. The BCA argued that top threshold should be lowered. It also recommended what it described as a “state concierge service” for monitoring and speeding up decisions, suggesting a model used in Queensland could be replicated across the county.",Karen Middleton
headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/13/limp-bizkit-universal-music-group-lawsuit,2024-10-13,Limp Bizkit’s fraud lawsuit rattles music industry: ‘These accusations are massive’ | Limp Bizkit | The Guardian,,"One of the world’s largest music companies has been accused of depriving “potentially hundreds” of artists and bands of their royalties by the 90s nu-metal bandLimp Bizkit. Three decades after it rose to prominence, the band and its founder, Fred Durst, alleges thatUniversal MusicGroup (UMG) owes more than $200m after fraudulently concealing royalties from the band.  In a lawsuit filed inCalifornia, attorneys representing Durst, Limp Bizkit and Flawless Records accused UMG of using software “deliberately designed to conceal artists’ (including Plaintiffs’) royalties” so it can pocket the profits. UMG is one of the most powerful forces in the global music industry, with a roster spanning from Taylor Swift and Neil Diamond to Dr Dre and Renee Rapp. The company did not respond to multiple invitations tocomment. Limp Bizkit claims it was not paid “a single cent by UMG in any royalties” until taking legal action, despite a “tremendous” resurgence in popularity in recent years, with its songs played hundreds of millions of times on streaming platforms in 2024 alone. The lawsuit, filed in California federal court, claims that many more bands and acts might also be getting shortchanged. Attorneys for Durst, Limp Bizkit and Flawless Records go so far as to suggest that a pre-trial discovery process – in which both sides of a case exchange information – will “show that potentially hundreds of other artists have likewise been wrongfully defrauded regarding their royalties, showing that the system was intentionally designed to commit fraud on Plaintiffs and other artists”. “These accusations are massive,” said Jay Gilbert, a music industry consultant and former executive at UMG and Warner Music Group. He is skeptical. “My gut tells me that this isn’t a systematic scheme to withhold royalties. It’s more of an accounting issue that’s blown up,” Gilbert said. “It sounded pretty damning and pretty heavy-handed, but in my experience, I think it’s something less dramatic.” This lawsuit was “the nuclear option”, added Mark Tavern, who previously worked at record companies including UMG and Sony Music. “I think it’s designed to force a settlement, and make it happen quickly.” “It’s a bit over the top,” said Tavern, who now lectures on the music industry at the University of New Haven. “It can probably be easily explained by bureaucracy, or incompetence,” or the sheer volume of payments processed by a music firm as large as UMG, he said. Durst claims he was told by UMG that he had not received any royalty statements because his account was still so far from recoupment, with executives at the firm suggesting it had paid Limp Bizkit some $43m in advances over the years, according to the lawsuit. When representatives of Durst and Limp Bizkit gained access to UMG’s portal for royalty statements in April, however, they claim to have noticed balances that indicated it owed more than $1m. In August, UMG paid just over $1m to Limp Bizkit and $2.3m to Flawless Records, according to the lawsuit, which says executives blamed the failure to pay sooner on an error with new software. Questions over royalty payments arise “all the time”, according to Gilbert, but rarely explode into the open. “This sort of dirty laundry is not aired commonly,” he said, with issues typically resolved through audits “behind the scenes”. The global music industry has been rapidly transformed over recent decades, first by the rise of downloads, and then by streaming. Finding and listening to songs has never been easier, thanks to hundreds of millions of tracks that stack the libraries of platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. Take Break Stuff by Limp Bizkit. It was first released in May 2000, but you might hear it in passing while watching TV, scrolling through social media, or playing a video game. Gone are the days when you would visit a local record store, go through the racks, find the album, and ultimately listen back to the song. It’s just a few taps away. Even Limp Bizkit’s attorneys acknowledged that the band – which split up in 2006, and reformed in 2009 – had a “relatively quiet period” in the early 2010s. In the lawsuit, however, they claim that interest in the band began to increase “exponentially” around 2017, leading it to sell out arenas and headline festivals. “There is a big pop-punk revival going on,” observed Tavern. “The current generation [of fans] is looking back 20 or 25 years.” Such “heritage” acts and artists, as they are referred to by music industry executives, are prized by record labels. UMG sought Durst’s approval to reissue Limp Bizkit’s 2000 album Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water on vinyl last year, according to the lawsuit, and “repeatedly asked” him to get involved with an anniversary rerelease of Significant Other, another of its albums. To Durst, it seemed like a “money grab”. The complaint alleges that the plaintiffs are still owed much more than they have been paid. Durst, Limp Bizkit and Flawless Records are demanding a jury trial. Their case is already making waves. ​“Everyone is talking about it,” observed Tavern, who noted the complicated nature of calculating music royalties in the streaming era had led to widespread confusion – and, sometimes, suspicion of the industry’s dominant firms. ​ “The way the money gets paid is totally different now, and much more convoluted,” he said. “You can point to 450 million streams, but that is not the same as 450 million records.” Gilbert said: “I think cooler heads will prevail,” suggesting that attorneys for either side would probably meet privately to examine the facts. “This thing will be resolved,” he said. “I think it’s going to go away.”",Callum Jones
headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/three-armed-robot-maira-pro-s-conductor-makes-debut-dresden,2024-10-13,Three-armed robot conductor makes debut in Dresden | Germany | The Guardian,,"She’s not long on charisma or passion but keeps perfect rhythm and is never prone to temperamental outbursts against the musicians beneath her three batons. Meet MAiRA Pro S, the next-generation robot conductor who made her debut this weekend in Dresden. Her two performances in the eastern German city are intended to show off the latest advances in machine maestros, as well as music written explicitly to harness 21st-century technology. The artistic director of Dresden’s Sinfoniker, Markus Rindt, said the intention was “not to replace human beings” but to perform complex music that human conductors would find impossible.  The Sinfoniker, long known for innovation and political statements, is celebrating its 25th anniversary with theRobotersinfonieat the Hellerau hall in a concert divided into two parts, one purely human and, after the interval, one that is robot-led. In the second half, three-armed MAiRA clutches a trio of stubby lightsabers, each with a different colour, to mark time. The ensemble is divided into three parts, each responding to its own baton to create cross rhythms. The composer Andreas Gundlach wrote the aptly named Semiconductor’s Masterpiece for 16 brass musicians and four percussionists playing wildly diverging time signatures. Some begin slowly and accelerate while the others slow down. Gundlach told the local public broadcaster MDR that MAiRA’s technical skills ensured the music sounded smooth, “like it came from a single source”. To pull off a two-decade-long dream, Rindt worked with specialists from Technical University Dresden’s CeTI, which stands for Centre for Tactile Internet with Human-in-the-Loop. It pursues innovation based on the principle that robots and people can cooperate rather than compete. Rindt taught MAiRA conducting as he would a human, displaying arm movements up to 40 times so she could integrate and adopt them with ever-increasing complexity during two years in development.

But we cannot maintain the status quo | Celeste Liddle | The Guardian,,"Ayear has passed since the ill-fatedvoice referendum. In that time, and indeed in the time leading up to the referendum itself, I repeatedly expressed my views. There was so much that was wrong with the process, that was dehumanising, and that was distressing about the entire situation. But while Indigenous community members have had to pick up the pieces, regroup and begin discussions about the way forward, the majority of Australia has maintained the status quo. The voice was never going to be a silver bullet. No matter how much the Albanese government attempted to sell it as such, the reality was that what was on the table was a smidgen better than nothing. Despite this, the proposal was still a bridge too far for the majority of Australians when it came to recognising the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.  I don’t want to revisit the time and the fallout. It is depressing to recall just how readily vast proportions of the Australian public allow themselves to absorb misinformation campaigns, or how readily they see Indigenous people gaining a bit more than “no power” as an existential threat. As I have been clear too, the misinformation was not just in the no camp – the yes camp were more than willing to paint themselves as champions for anti-racism when the reality was that any reform to actually conquer racism in Australia was not on the table. It was window dressing, plain and simple. I do, though, at this juncture want to look at how Australia can move forward. The Uluru statement from the heart was, after all, a three-part proposal, and the agendas of truth-telling and treaty cannot be allowed to fall by the wayside in the failure of the voice to get up, even if our prime minister isdodging these responsibilities. Here’s a few truths to kick off the truth-telling process: First, the lack of basic civics education that Australians receive is telling. Adding to this, many Australians choose to remain ignorant about our political systems and structures for their entire lives. There was a reason why the conservative no campaign’s “if you don’t know, vote no” slogan was so successful – most Australians do not know, nor are they particularly willing to find out. If they feel happy and secure in their own back yard, there really is no reason to step outside it. I maintain that many Australians went to the ballot box having no clue what they were voting for. Do they actually know what the constitution is and how it works? Do they understand the political system Australia uses and how it would interact with a proposed body that had no power of political veto? Both sides of the debate drew on public ignorance of the constitution, framing the document and our inclusion in it as alternately reconciliatory and threatening. I find this frustrating. The constitution is a still-racist document that reinforced a foreign regime without Indigenous people’s consent, but this is something that most people don’t want to confront. Future generations cannot be allowed to grow up with this same ignorance. Second, we will get nowhere unless Australia gets significantly more comfortable with confronting its history, and how this history informs the present. It would be nice, for example, to see a dual-naming exercise happen in Australia that is accepted as a symbol of pride, rather than an opportunity to jump on social media and complain about how any such move is “political correctness gone mad”. Education about massacres, assimilation policies, the mission system, wage theft, the wardship systems, land theft, etc, cannot remain the sole interest of those already at the table. There is a colonial arrogance that permeates society suggesting there is nothing to be learned from the First Peoples, despite this country being home to the longest continuing cultures in the world. If we want to begin the process of moving forward, people need to begin opening their ears and their hearts. Finally, a mature nationmustcome to an agreement on how to move forward. This means the Labor government honouring the treaty process that is part of the Uluru Statement that they said they were committed to implementing upon their election. The prime minister attempted to dodge this by pointing out that treaty processes were already under way in a few states and territories. To my mind, though, this does not preclude the federal government taking action, particularly considering they are the ones with the direct link to the crown under whose name this land was claimed as a colony. Decisions can be made federally on what the non-negotiables would be in a treaty process – items such as the right to land and compensation, the protection of language and knowledge, dual naming, equal service provision, designated representative seats in all levels of governance, no imposition of policy without proper consultation, etc. There are so many ways this country could commit not only to a healthier and more equitable way forward, but also to a more tolerant and racially diverse society. It is time to remember that this country was founded on the erasure of those who were already here, and to rectify that enormous historical wrong. I truly hope that in my lifetime we are never faced with another toxic campaign like the voice referendum again. It’s a fool’s hope – Australia loves to debate the humanity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and seems to find ways to put us back in our place. At the very least, a population making more informed decisions after some truth-telling and education would be a welcome change. Celeste Liddle is an Arrernte woman living in Melbourne.

As the results rolled in she knew there was a possibility the proposal wouldn’t succeed but held on to hope until the end of the night.  It was a blow for her and many other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people when60% of the votes said no. “We felt in that moment the country didn’t want to include us and we felt rejected,” the Wiradjuri and Fijian woman says. She is the co-chair of the Uluru youth dialogue, a collective of young people who support the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which calls for voice, treaty and truth for First Nations people. Reflecting on the process and lead-up to the 2023 referendum, Cama says she and her Uluru dialogue colleagues did their best to reach everyday Australians but faced the challenges of time, distance and misinformation. “It was a hard process,” she says. “This was the first time we were going to a referendum in the age of social media. Misinformation played a large role.” Wrong and misleading commentary surrounding the voice referendum was a source of frustration for journalist and presenter John Paul Janke throughout the campaign. “The lies and misinformation about if the proposal got up then Aboriginal people would take your land and close up beaches ... we saw the same in the 90s during the native title debate and the Mabo decision and land rights debates of the 70s and 80s,” he says. “To see that misinformation really gain traction and be used as a weapon against ending the status quo, it was quite frustrating to see that play out in Aboriginal communities but to see it play out also in the wider community.” Janke travelled the country in the lead-up to the ballot as the host of NITV’s The Point and says there was a diversity of views from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the nation. He and the Point team have continued their overland tour to engage in post-referendum conversations and he says the hurt of the result is still palpable. “There is a lot of pain and that feeling of rejection, that the nation rejected Aboriginal people in October last year,” he says. “People are still overcoming that pain.” Laura Thompson has seen it reflected in her own work and community too. The Gunditjmara woman founded streetwear brand and social enterpriseClothing the Gaps, which creates clothing and merchandise aiming to influence social change. Since the referendum, she says, the organisation has collected the reflections of more than 200 people. “Mob are still grieving and a lot of them are still, I think, traumatised by the whole year,” she says. “We woke up in a world where you go into a meeting room and look out and think 60% of these people voted that we shouldn’t have any say over our lives, and everything changed.” Thompson said Indigenous people have not had a chance to heal from the hurt of the result and experiences of the campaign. A year on, she says it’s important to talk about this pain and grief but also to keep pressure on governments to pursue treaty and truth-telling processes. Thompson says she encourages people to “wear their values” on Monday by pulling out their yes campaign merchandise and still advocating for First Nations people. “On a day that’s going to bring up a whole lot of memories of the past year and of October 14, that allyship and that visibility of support in community is going to be really important,” she insists. “We’re doing free upcycling at Clothing the Gaps but you don’t have to do that, I think anything that signals to the world that you stand with First Nations people now and into the future is really important.” Cama holds on to the hope she felt on the night of the referendum, saying there were 6.2 million people who voted in favour of a voice. As a young Aboriginal woman, she feels responsibility to carry on the fight for constitutional recognition for her elders, the Indigenous communities who voted yes and for future generations, including her own younger siblings and son. “We still need recognition, we still need structural reform and we need a seat at the table,” she says. “That doesn’t go away because the referendum failed.”",

Charles and Queen Camilla will arrive in Australia on 18 October, with stops in Sydney and Canberra during their six-day visit.  The conversation about Australia’s future under the British monarchy has reared its head in light of the visit after a letter from King Charles to the Australian Republic Movement (ARM)was publicly reported this week. In the letter, Charles indicated he would not stand in the way if Australia wished to become a republic. The letter was in response to one sent by the ARM in December 2023, requesting a meeting with the King during his proposed visit to discuss Australia’s future relationship with the UK, and asking him to “consider publicly supporting the will of the Australian people and their desires to move to a republic”. In the reply, which was sent in March, Nathan Ross, assistant private secretary to the King, thanked the group for its “thoughtfulness in writing as you did” and reiterated the King and Queen’s “love and affection for Australia and Australians”. “The King appreciated that you took the time to write and asked me to reply on his behalf,” wrote Ross in the letter, seen by the Guardian. “Please be assured that your views on this matter have been noted very carefully. His Majesty, as a constitutional Monarch, acts on the advice of his Ministers, and whether Australia becomes a republic is, therefore, a matter for the Australian public to decide.” Australiaheld a referendum in 1999on the issue of becoming a republic, in which 54.9% of the country voted against. Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has previously voiced strong support for the country becoming a republic, saying: “Australia should have an Australian as our head of state.” When he took power in 2022,he appointed one of his MPs as assistant minister for the republic, signalling his intent to move towards another referendum. However, Albanese recently indicated that a second referendum was not a priority, and the assistant ministrywas abolished in July. Nathan Hansford, co-chair of ARM, said while the group had thought it was “quite unlikely” the King would agree to their request to support their cause – thereby eliminating himself as head of state in Australia – they wanted to have a respectful conversation about Australia’s future. “It’s up to Australia to decide what they want to do with the head of state. And what better time for us to have a think about that then when the King is here this week.” Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Hansford said according to research conducted by the group, 8% of Australians are “rusted-on monarchists”, 60% of Australians preferred an Australian as head of state and 40% of Australians didn’t even realise that Charles was the country’s head of state. “So we’re hoping that there’s a real conversation-starter, by Charles and Camilla coming here,” he said. “We’re a really unique country, we’re a country with such a long history – tens of thousands of years of Indigenous culture – and with a really multicultural community that’s been growing so much since we had the last referendum in 1999 … and most of us can’t really understand having our head of state as someone who’s born into the role and not selected on their merit. “People are really starting to think: well, is this who we are in 2024 as as a country?” Philip Benwell, national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, said the current system has served Australia well. “Our constitution provides stability and security,” he said. “There’s never been a major crisis with our constitution since 1901 [when Australia federated] … That’s what we are campaigning against, not for the sake of the King or, earlier, the Queen, but because we believe our constitution best protects our democracy in this country because it blocks politicians from total and absolute power.” Benwell said while the ARM had every right to write to Charles requesting a meeting, it would have been a breach of protocol for the King to have accepted their invitation. “The King cannot officially meet with me, just as he cannot officially meet with the republicans, because [the republic question] is an ongoing issue in this country. He’s here to meet the people, not to become involved in political issues, he’s above that as king.”",Kate Lyons

Are we becoming desensitised? | Kate Fitz-Gibbon | The Guardian,,"For more than a decade, I have studied the killing of women by men’s violence. From my own work, and a global body of research from which I draw, I know that this violence is inherently preventable, and within that knowledge lies hope –the hope that improved responses, more effective early interventions and a true commitment to prevention, all spearheaded bysustained national leadership, will drive down the rates of women killed by men known to them. Over the last six months, however, more often than not that sense of hope has turned into anger and despair. My newly minted academic self in 2012 thought we would be further ahead by now. As recently as three years ago, when my book Our National Shame was published, I felt that the catalyst for change might be at hand. But I appreciate now perhaps better than ever how significant the challenge is, how profound the crisis of men’s violence against women and children in Australia is.  In 2024, more than 12 years after I completed my PhD examining the sentencing of men who killed their female intimate partners in Australia, I have been reminded all too often of the pertinence of a quote attributed to author Margaret Atwood: “Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.” While the quote is about 40 years old, it remains starkly relevant. The horrific events of 2024 in Australia demonstrate that women continue to have good reason to fear men’s violence. Throughout this year the increase in number of women allegedly killed by men known to them has been wide reaching – it serves as a critical reminder that violence against women affects all sections of the Australian community. Deaths have occurred across Australian states and territories, and spanned rural and metropolitan areas. The knowledge we have so far about the alleged killings shows the range of different circumstances in which women come to be killed, most often by men known to them. Indeed, that is perhaps the one commonality in these cases – that when a woman is killed the alleged use of fatal violence is most likely by a man whom not only was known to her, but whom she once trusted as a former or current intimate partner. As the toll of women killed has risen all too frequently this year so too has the chorus of frontline workers advocating, quite rightly, for an increase in funding of crisis services to meet demand. While there have beennumerous positive funding announcements at the federal and state levels throughout 2024, it remains the fact that the level of funding committed in this area is not commensurate with the scale of the problem. In 2023 the women’s safety sector estimated that at least $1bn annually was needed at the crisis end alone to support victim-survivors seeking help. On top of this, as the focus of theNational Plan to End Violence Against Women and Childrensets out, commitments to prevention, early intervention as well as response and recovery are essential components of addressing this national crisis. In a year where it is easy to feel deflated and like we are moving backwards, we must not lose sight of evidence that tells us that intimate partner femicidesarepreventable. But achieving elimination of men’s violence against women will require whole of system responses and reform. The breadth of circumstances involved in the cases of women killed in 2024 alone demonstrates why tinkering at any one point of the system will not deliver the transformative change need to better secure women’s safety from men’s violence. It’s a truism to say that women’s lives matter, but then why is it that the intensity of fatal attacks on women has reached a level not seen for over a decade in Australia? According toCounting Dead Women Australia, a voluntary initiative led by researchers from the online group Destroy the Joint, at least 39 women were killed by men’s violence in the first six months of 2024. In recent years, on average, at least one woman has been killed each week by men’s violence in Australia – in 2022 this equated to the deaths of 57 women nationally;in 2023, at least 64 women were killed. There have also been times in recent years when the frequency with which women have been killed has raised greater alarm among policymakers and advocates. In late October and early November 2023, over a 10-day period, a woman was killed in Australia every two days. Each of the five killings occurred in a different Australian state or territory and involved a range of different circumstances, but they all had two things in common: the alleged use of fatal male violence, and that the alleged male perpetrators were known to the female victim before her death. There are echoes here of late 2018, when six Australian women were killed by men’s violence over a five-day period. The deaths of these women elicited little outcry and even less political acknowledgment or calls for action. Further cementing awareness of the depth of the crisis we face, throughout 2024 there have been numerous instances of children in Australia killed, most often – but not exclusively – allegedly by adult men known to them. I worry that as a community, we are becoming – or have become – desensitised to women’s deaths. And what of the international context? How to communicate what the global toll of men’s violence against women and children means in terms of our day-to-day lives? Consider that the “average” Australian reads between 200 and 300 words a minute. By this measure, it would take an average Australian anywhere between 60 and 90 minutes to read the short book about violence against women that I have written. The brutal reality is that in that time, it is estimated that at least five women – and potentially up to eight women – around the world will die from men’s violence. On average, a woman is killed once every 11 minutes. This is a distressing reality, but one that we must acknowledge. It is only through acknowledgment, by shining a fierce light on the problem, that we can drive the transformational change so desperately needed.

After a couple of minutes she spotted one. And then another tawny frogmouth. And then another. “I just felt like a bird god,” she says. “Birds are great,” she muses. “There’s so many. You think you’ve seen them all, and you’ve barely touched the surface of how many there are.” This week thousands of Australians have the opportunity to try 20 minutes of birdwatching as part of BirdLife Australia’s annualAussie Bird Count. Hickey is excited to be among them. “Having an excuse to take 20 minutes out of my day to go look at birds is pretty awesome because it’s such a meditative thing,” she says. Sean Dooley, BirdLife Australia’s self-proclaimed “chief bird nerd”, says the event is aimed at the “bird curious”, rather than the hardcore birder, “although we love to get their input too”. Between 14 and 20 October, Dooley says everyone and anyone “who kind of likes birds” is invited to spend 20 minutes getting to know their local inhabitants: in their back yard, street, balcony or local parklands. “This is a nice, gentle way to open your eyes to the little soap operas that go on outside your window every day,” he says. The annual citizen science event has been running for a decade. Last year, more than 60,000 people counted about 3.5 million birds. Rainbow lorikeets have been the most commonly counted across Australia by twice as many as the next species. The “mind-blowingly spectacular-looking birds” are easy to identify, colourful, loud and often in big flocks, Dooley says.

His tip for counting more birds is to try early in the morning, when birds are actively feeding and more vocal. “They’re up and about, and they’re letting each other know that they’ve survived the night.”",Petra Stock

They are often overwhelmingly negative, or display a victim mentality, refusing to believe that anything that happens to them is their fault. “A lot of times, they don’t actually want solutions or advice – they just want to offload,” says Reading. And while they might be intently focused on themselves, “there’s not a great deal of self-awareness”. It’s not just their own patterns of behaviour that these individuals are oblivious to: emotional vampires are defined by their inability to empathise, leading them to vent their frustrations without thinking how it might affect or be received by the other person. Carla Manly, a clinical psychologist based in California, says such behaviour reflects a lack of emotional intelligence. “When somebody is an empathic human being, even if they have a high need, when they reach out for support, they will be aware of your emotional state first.” They might ask you if now is a good time to talk, or pick up on cues that suggest it isn’t. Emotional vampires pay no such mind, says Manly. “They are only caring for their own appetite, their own needs.” The key point is that the behaviour is consistent, even chronic, says Manly. There are many reasons a friend might temporarily be more demanding, or less present, such as after a breakup or a period of poor mental health. But in functional friendships, there is an underlying sense of give and take. “We want somebody to be invested as we are invested; a mutual reciprocity. It’s not always 50-50, but overall there is a sense of balance.” An emotional vampire will resist that equilibrium, betraying a fundamental egocentrism. Any attempts to change the subject can be met with one-upmanship, dismissiveness or even hostility. “If you do then challenge them on it, they’re so resistant that you might end up getting attacked,” says Reading. But to characterise one person as the predatory bloodsucker and the other as their hapless victim can be reductive. After all, vampires can’t prey on just anyone: you have to invite them in. “If someone has managed to get into this position of being completely domineering, then obviously we’ve allowed it to some extent, or possibly enabled it,” says Jenny van Hooff, a sociologist at Manchester Metropolitan University. Even with the best of intentions, it can be all too easy to get sucked into the dynamic. Beth, 38, befriended a friend of a friend, wishing to support her through her first pregnancy. The younger woman struggled with her family and was not in contact with the father of her child and Beth thought she could help. But every time they spoke, Beth felt depleted, depressed and helpless. “I started to realise that I’d repeat the same things over and over again and she would never follow the suggestions, nor listen to me.” When the woman started volunteering information about her childhood traumas, Beth felt that a line had been crossed. “It wasn’t about the trauma per se, but the fact that she would ‘vomit’ information without really listening,” she says. “The next time she called, I told her I only had 15 minutes, and the time after that, I made up an excuse so that we wouldn’t speak.” Reading says it is especially common for women to work to maintain ties they find unrewarding and even actively unpleasant, often having been conditioned to keep the peace and prioritise others’ needs above their own. “Effectively, women are raised to believe that you’re either selfish or selfless.” She often sees adult women struggling to protect themselves against their overbearing mothers: a “particularly painful dynamic” that was probably established in childhood. Emotional vampires might also enter into our lives in the form of co-workers or co-parents, Reading says – making it harder to create distance. Schoolfriends are another common culprit, as people naturally grow apart over time, but feel reluctant to cut longstanding ties. “Just because there’s a legacy to this friendship, it doesn’t mean that you don’t have a right to choose what shape it takes,” says Reading. It’s possible to maintain the relationship and still take steps to protect ourselves. She suggests considering how much you can give to this individual and tailoring the interaction to bring out the best in them. “If you’ve got someone in your social circle that’s really overdramatic, loves chaos and wants to be the centre of attention, maybe don’t go out for coffee with several friends, because it will become that person’s show,” says Reading. Instead, you could go for a walk together, one on one; nature might help to “diffuse that wall of noise”, she suggests. “Or, even better: go and see a film together … Think laterally about how you can enjoy time and space together in a way that feels healthy for you.” Managing our own expectations can also help make those difficult relationships more sustainable, says Manly. Accepting that one particular friend is not inclined to give a listening ear can alleviate your disappointment or anguish when they speak only of themselves. Cutting old friends loose can backfire, she says. “There’s something really precious about those relationships, because they carry the energy of ‘I knew you when’ and ‘You knew me when’ … The minute you part from the relationship, you fracture something in that sense of continuity.” But by recognising the value of those shared experiences and memories, the relationship can become a lot easier to maintain, Manly says – despite all the ways in which you might have grown apart. “We don’t necessarily need to completely cut off the relationship,” she says. “We simply energetically and emotionally create greater distance. And to tell you the truth, when it comes to the emotional vampire, because they are more egocentric, they may not notice it.” Both experts agree that emotional vampires tend to move on when one energy source cuts off the supply. If this seems callous, consider the costs of maintaining the relationship as it is, says Reading. “At the end of the day, it’s also OK to protect your peace.” It can also pay to be more upfront and give a friend a gentle heads-up about how their behaviour is affecting you. It may be an uncomfortable conversation – but it can be productive. For Troy, 32, confronting how he and his friend of a decade had drifted apart was helpful in changing their course. They had met at university, during a period of change in their lives, but in the subsequent years Troy’s friend had got hung up on a messy breakup. For many years, Troy says, they were stuck in a pattern of him being her shoulder to cry on. “Our friendship shifted from a place of feeling mutual to a point where our conversations were always about her and her relationship and how it was affecting her,” he says. “The gravitational pull was always towards the dark things she was going through.” Troy tried to respond with compassion, not only hearing his friend out, but trying different ways to help her move on. “I’d always leave our conversations feeling really down – and also that nothing I was doing was helping,” he says. “There was a period where we even had a moratorium on talking about him, because I was not interested in having the same conversation we’d been having for the past five or six years.” Eventually, Troy began to withdraw, volunteering less about himself and investing less in the friendship. Matters came to a head when his friend said she felt something had changed between them. They ended up having an argument. “It was a very hard conversation and things were said that were not easy for either of us to hear,” says Troy. But it also released the tensions that had been building on both sides. “The fight actually acted as a reset button and we sort of made commitments in terms of how we wanted to be better friends to each other,” he says. When they met again a few weeks later, it felt “much more even – there was a sense that we’d gotten past it”. Being prepared to have those difficult conversations with people who matter to us can be productive, not only for our relationships, but for our sense of who we are within them, Reading says. Particularly in the case of family or close friends: “One of the functions of those relationships is to smooth off each other’s rough edges.” One of Reading’s clients recently told an old friend, who had complained about feeling lonely, how she might be inadvertently pushing people away. The friend took it on, says Reading. “So let’s not write people off. It’s about making that distinction between aniceperson, who doesn’t ruffle feathers, and being akindperson, who is allowing others to learn and grow.” Manly is more circumspect about emotional vampires’ ability to change. “If they are doing even a modicum of self-work, they may be able to hear you, but in most cases they’re not – that’s why they have those patterns.” For any feedback to be received in good faith, “there has to be a desire to change”. There are also often unforeseen costs to “speaking one’s truth”, Manly adds. “It may not get you anywhere and in fact it may create rupture.” Troy says he persevered with his friend because of their shared history and his faith in the real bond underpinning it. When he found himself feeling similarly drained by a looser friendship, he had felt more able to walk away. “She would always complain about being single, how busy work was, about not having any friends,” Troy says. “I became increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that she thought we were best friends, when for me she was someone I saw out of obligation every four months.” These experiences, he says, have taught him “to be more intentional with my friendships and who I devote time to – but also to be more transparent and clear when problems are arising and I can feel that balance shifting in a significant way”. The challenges of vampire friendships may feel particularly heightened and unexpected because the nuclear family has become less dominant as the organising structure of our society. Platonic bonds have been rightly recognised as important and enriching, but the popular description of friends as “the family you choose” can set up unrealistic expectations – and belie the frequent difficulty of navigating them, says Van Hooff. “When you look at research, people maintain friendships that they really do not enjoy.” It’s perhaps in response to the uncritical celebration of friendship as always equal, effortless and enriching that the concept of “emotional vampires” has taken flight, Van Hooff suggests. “The rules of friendships are really opaque and difficult to work out and some people are more skilled at navigating them than others.” The next time you find yourself in a never-ending interview with an emotional vampire, you might look for ways to defang the monster, and even to understand them, before resorting to banishment. But for those starting to feel apprehensive about looking into the mirror, Reading is reassuring. “For anyone thinking: ‘God, am I an energy vampire?’ I think the fact that you’re asking that question would suggest you’re not.” All case study names have been changed",Elle Hunt

But please remember – or trust me – that part of Moore’s talent is the ability to transform, to step back from herself. She is a 63-year-old character actor in the body of a movie star. Anyway: “It was so amazing, because it was these two female friends,” Moore goes on, “and one was saying, ‘I know you, I see you’. And the other was affirming that she saw the right thing. It was fascinating. I thought, nobody’s gonna make a movie about these two, but that’s who most of us are. Right?” In her 40-year career, which has spanned auteur’s art films like the exquisiteSafe, to huge blockbusters likeThe Hunger Games, as well as award-winning dramas likeStill Alice(for which, after many nominations, she won her Oscar in 2014) and recent TV work like the audaciousMary& George, Moore has played characters who are defiant and struggling, sometimes deviant, trapped in an often-gorgeous prison of domestic horror.  As a child, she moved 20 times, first across the US and then to Germany with her brother and mother, a psychiatric social worker, following the trajectory of her father’s military career. Whenever she started at a new school, she’d quietly watch how the students danced, how they talked, quickly learning how to fit in, a skill she transferred to acting, first in a soap opera in 1984, and then on film. On the subway, as in film roles, she’s interested in “reality and complexity” rather than fantasy. “I’ve never met anyone personally who’s been to the moon; I’ve never met a queen,” she explains. “Yet there are lots of movies about queens. Even though I have had incredible privilege and met people who’ve done amazing things, the majority of my experience and relationships are with people living regular lives. Nobody’s a magician, nobody’s a wizard, no one is in outer space. Real people’s lives are rich and extraordinary and wonderful and I like to see them examined – I like to examine them, too.” We’re meeting to talk about her new film,The Room Next Door. It’s a lush, lovely exploration of mortality and, because it’s by Pedro Almodóvar (his first English-language feature), it includes the art direction of a character’s death, down to the colour of their final lipstick. “There is this elevated visual sense,” Moore says, of Almodóvar’s films. “Women look beautiful, the world looks beautiful.” Even death looks beautiful. “There are filmmakers who say: this world is harsh, so the film’s going to look rough. No one’s going to be lit. It’s going to look real,” she goes on. “And I’m like,doeslife look like that?Doeslife look harsh? Is that reality? Pedro sees beauty: in big piles of fruit, wonderful books, the jackets people wear and the lipstick they have on. And it feels like a feast, you know? A celebration, I think, of life.” Moore plays Ingrid, who is reunited with an old friend, Martha (played by Tilda Swinton), in a hospital room. The room overlooks a Manhattan cityscape on which, so enchanting is Martha’s receding life, pink snow falls. She decides to rent a house somewhere beautiful to take a euthanasia pill, and asks Ingrid to be there, in the room next door. It’s a tender, strange film, a duet about friendship, time and the end. Its beauty reads as defiance. In response to an old lover, a lecturer on the climate crisis, Ingrid says, “You can’t go around telling people there’s no hope. There are a lot of ways to live inside a tragedy.” The line has come back to me since at odd times; pouring milk, scrolling news. “When Pedro’s films begin, the canvas feels kind of vast and personal to him,” Moore says. “By the time you finishthe film, it feels very small and personal to you.” At the Venice premiere, the crowd applauded for 17 minutes, almost a sixth of the running time of the film. The ovation became its own news story. “That feeling of reciprocity was wonderful,” Almodóvar tells me. “I felt the audience had understood what we wanted to tell them.” But “the ovation was so long that, after exchanging hugs and kisses with Julianne, Tilda and my brother, we didn’t know what else to do, except smile and put our hands on our hearts”. Almodóvar wanted Moore for the role because he knew she could appear “terrified, friendly, compassionate, angry, understanding, stony, slightly eccentric, tender, empathetic but without going too far, fearful and daring at the same time”, he says. After sending Swinton the script, Almodóvar asked her who she thought should play Ingrid. Swinton emails me, remembering: “My heart was pounding in case he said a different name. Our emails crossed: they both said JULIE. Hallelujah!” Swinton and Moore had circled each other’s orbits for years, but, she says, “coming together in this way was a particular blessing. It gave us the chance to catch up on each other’s entire lives – from morning to night – and in between set-ups, Pedro was always marvelling: ‘You two are always talking talking talking!’ What grace to have such a way of becoming friends,” she adds, “which we now most assuredly are.” After the premiere, people approached Moore to discuss first the film and then themselves. Almodóvar’s work, she sighs, “makes people want to reveal themselves more because they feel so seen by the experience. What he’s done with this film is really encapsulate what it means to witness someone,” Moore says, “to accompany them during a passage of mortality. For me and Tilda, of course, it brings all of that into relief. It brings it back to how you can experience your life, I think, in a more complete way, in a more present way.” Sometimes the process was painful, she admits. They were shooting in Madrid, away from her husband (film director Bart Freundlich, who she met while shooting his filmThe Myth of Fingerprintsin 1996) and their two adult children, and the subject matter was, she says with a slow nod, “heavy”. But at the same time, “sort of wonderful, because you go, ‘I need to be awake. I need to be alive to the idea of mortality all the time’.” It’s fairly early in the morning to be talking about death, but Almodóvar’s film, she agrees, requires it. “His movies are like a dream,” Moore smiles, “They’re not quite real, but their themes are so real – it’s personal, it’s political. It’s all of the stuff of life.” On the political, I ask, how does she deal with the themes, like death and the climate emergency, he explores? She briefly hoots. For a second I worry I should have asked, perhaps, about her skincare routine, or favourite colour. “No, but sometimes I feel challenged, because I’m just a human being, called upon to make big proclamations about the end of the world!” Still, I wait. “You try to be a good person. You know, you try to be alive. You try to do what you can do in your own sphere and reach as far as you can.” She loves the Nick Hornby book,How To Be Good, because, “at the end, the only conclusion he reaches is that: you can’t. Instead, you find solace in art and in time and in relationships. People love narrative – we all love a beginning, a middle and an end. But we don’t have that in life until we’re dead. And then we don’t even know what the story is, because we’re not there to see the end. So, in fact, we have this expectation that life is going to be like this …” a) leading to b), leading to c), etc, “and that we can contain it. We keep telling these stories so we have that kind of solace. But I feel as if life is more like this…” She mimes a long, wobbly line. “It spreads out horizontally and we don’t know where it’s going. And so it’s … a challenge!” A number of directors Moore has worked with have talked about her magical way with silence, the things she says when she’s saying nothing. “One of the best things about Julianne, aside from an extraordinary talent for both comedy and drama, is a physique that allows her to play any kind of character with the same intensity,” Almodóvar tells me. “And she knows how to listen. She also has a fantastic deep voice,” he adds, thoughtfully. “She should sing.” Moore explains, slowly – on screen: “You’re always looking for what feels human. One of the things about acting that’s always challenging is that you have to do all of this work, then also be ready to abandon it so that it actually happens to you. So I think part of being silent is letting something occur to you while you’re actually on camera.” Are these sorts of lessons in acting also useful for real life? “They really are, because so often in life we have an expectation about how something’s going to happen. Then, just when I think I’m open to any possibility, something comes and surprises me. In acting, you want to try to be skinless. Because you want to have those things happen to you. It’s about getting those barriers down. In life, it’s very hard to be that way, because you want to protect yourself. But I think, ultimately, you’re more in touch with who you are and what you want and how you communicate if you can be that way.” Raw and skinless. “It’s just hard!” On stage or film, “there’s this tremendous freedom. I don’t know why some of us like doing that. And other people find their freedom in other places. But I can metabolise a lot of feelings and ideas while I’m doing it.” Where else does she find freedom? “In relationships. Friendship. I find a lot of freedom just walking around, too. I like to read, I love design, I love ceramics.” At my request, she scrabbles around to find a bowl she’s made. It’s about two palms wide, gold and glinting in the light. She made a whole collection cast in bronze and sold them to benefit a gun-safety organisation. “I said to the bronze artist,” Moore laughs, “‘Oh my God, it looks so amazing!’ She said, ‘The secret is, everything looks good in bronze!’” She loves making ceramics, she says, holding the bowl, as, “evidence of time”. When her children were little, 20 years ago, they’d visit her on set for lunch. “Being a parent, there’s a tremendous amount of compartmentalisation that occurs. But I liked the fact I had other responsibilities, other things to tend to.” Her son was three when she was filmingThe Hourswith Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep, “and he was with me the entire time. One of my biggest concerns was getting home, because he wouldn’t go to sleep until I was in the bed with him. My character was very depressed, and oh, it was all very complicated. He didn’t like the fact my character was pregnant – he would knock on my belly, try to take it off.” She was 37 when she had her first child but, “people have been asking me about age since I was 28. Often I’ll be interviewed and they’ll say, ‘I’m sorry to ask this question, my editors said I had to…’ Because people think women want to read about it.” What do you think? “I think no one wants to be defined by how old they are.Children don’t like being told, ‘Well, you’re this age, therefore X.’ And when you are 30, you don’t want to be told, ‘You’re 30, you should start worrying,’ and when you’re 60, you don’t want people telling you, ‘Don’t you think we should be wrapping this up now?’ It feels like a very tight way to define someone when, in fact, everybody is just having experiences of… being alive.” She takes a gentle, exasperated breath. “We all have a life cycle. We feel as if we’re always in the middle and we don’t know the end. Sometimes the age questions are really about business, you know, but then the deeper question,” she leans in, stagily, “and here we’re getting back to the dark part of this interview… the deeper question is about mortality.” She remembers something Gloria Steinem said: if women don’t have equality, they will continue to be valued only for their youth and beauty. “But if you do have autonomy, if you do have agency, then where you are in your life doesn’t really matter – you want to be able to experience all of it and know all of it has value.” We meander back to the women on the subway, the idea that each claimed to know who they were. “Well my God, we all want that, don’t we! The thing about identity, though, is that it’s always shifting.” Does she ever discover more about who she is through the characters she plays? “Yeah, that’s why I do it! It gives you a space to examine your feelings. I think when people talk about feeling cut off from themselves, it can be painful. And I think that for a lot of us doing this,” by this she means acting, “you do feel like there is a place where I can kind of mess around with my feelings.” She felt it in the scenes with Swinton as Martha in hospital, a recognition, and an understanding that while you might not be able to save someone, you can help simply by being there. She repeats the line, with weight: “There are lots of ways to live inside a tragedy,” whether a hospital room, a war, or a broken planet. “Life is hard, death is hard, sorrow is hard, grief, all of these things that we live with. You can’t say, ‘Oh, forget it. I withdraw.’ You have to be present with it. You live with it.” She nods. “This is what life is. We have children and we go to the movies and we talk like this. We persist!” We’re staring at each other now, a sort of mutual terror on the table between us, and I find myself apologising for asking questions about the horrors of being alive on such a fine morning and she chuckles merrily while pulling the band from her ponytail. “NoI’msorry,” she says. But, there’s always more than one thing happening at the same time, she reminds me – there’s always the tragedy, “the brutality”, as well as the beauty, and the quotidian reality of a woman’s working day. “Because, this entire time…” talking about, for instance, how to live when death is real, she smiles, “I’ve also been deep conditioning my hair.” The Room Next Door is in cinemas from 25 October",Eva Wiseman

We keep telling these stories so we have that kind of solace. But I feel as if life is more like this…” She mimes a long, wobbly line. “It spreads out horizontally and we don’t know where it’s going. And so it’s … a challenge!” A number of directors Moore has worked with have talked about her magical way with silence, the things she says when she’s saying nothing. “One of the best things about Julianne, aside from an extraordinary talent for both comedy and drama, is a physique that allows her to play any kind of character with the same intensity,” Almodóvar tells me. “And she knows how to listen. She also has a fantastic deep voice,” he adds, thoughtfully. “She should sing.” Moore explains, slowly – on screen: “You’re always looking for what feels human. One of the things about acting that’s always challenging is that you have to do all of this work, then also be ready to abandon it so that it actually happens to you. So I think part of being silent is letting something occur to you while you’re actually on camera.” Are these sorts of lessons in acting also useful for real life? “They really are, because so often in life we have an expectation about how something’s going to happen. Then, just when I think I’m open to any possibility, something comes and surprises me. In acting, you want to try to be skinless. Because you want to have those things happen to you. It’s about getting those barriers down. In life, it’s very hard to be that way, because you want to protect yourself. But I think, ultimately, you’re more in touch with who you are and what you want and how you communicate if you can be that way.” Raw and skinless. “It’s just hard!” On stage or film, “there’s this tremendous freedom. I don’t know why some of us like doing that. And other people find their freedom in other places. But I can metabolise a lot of feelings and ideas while I’m doing it.” Where else does she find freedom? “In relationships. Friendship. I find a lot of freedom just walking around, too. I like to read, I love design, I love ceramics.” At my request, she scrabbles around to find a bowl she’s made. It’s about two palms wide, gold and glinting in the light. She made a whole collection cast in bronze and sold them to benefit a gun-safety organisation. “I said to the bronze artist,” Moore laughs, “‘Oh my God, it looks so amazing!’ She said, ‘The secret is, everything looks good in bronze!’” She loves making ceramics, she says, holding the bowl, as, “evidence of time”. When her children were little, 20 years ago, they’d visit her on set for lunch. “Being a parent, there’s a tremendous amount of compartmentalisation that occurs. But I liked the fact I had other responsibilities, other things to tend to.” Her son was three when she was filmingThe Hourswith Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep, “and he was with me the entire time. One of my biggest concerns was getting home, because he wouldn’t go to sleep until I was in the bed with him. My character was very depressed, and oh, it was all very complicated. He didn’t like the fact my character was pregnant – he would knock on my belly, try to take it off.” She was 37 when she had her first child but, “people have been asking me about age since I was 28. Often I’ll be interviewed and they’ll say, ‘I’m sorry to ask this question, my editors said I had to…’ Because people think women want to read about it.” What do you think? “I think no one wants to be defined by how old they are.Children don’t like being told, ‘Well, you’re this age, therefore X.’ And when you are 30, you don’t want to be told, ‘You’re 30, you should start worrying,’ and when you’re 60, you don’t want people telling you, ‘Don’t you think we should be wrapping this up now?’ It feels like a very tight way to define someone when, in fact, everybody is just having experiences of… being alive.” She takes a gentle, exasperated breath. “We all have a life cycle. We feel as if we’re always in the middle and we don’t know the end. Sometimes the age questions are really about business, you know, but then the deeper question,” she leans in, stagily, “and here we’re getting back to the dark part of this interview… the deeper question is about mortality.” She remembers something Gloria Steinem said: if women don’t have equality, they will continue to be valued only for their youth and beauty. “But if you do have autonomy, if you do have agency, then where you are in your life doesn’t really matter – you want to be able to experience all of it and know all of it has value.” We meander back to the women on the subway, the idea that each claimed to know who they were. “Well my God, we all want that, don’t we! The thing about identity, though, is that it’s always shifting.” Does she ever discover more about who she is through the characters she plays? “Yeah, that’s why I do it! It gives you a space to examine your feelings. I think when people talk about feeling cut off from themselves, it can be painful. And I think that for a lot of us doing this,” by this she means acting, “you do feel like there is a place where I can kind of mess around with my feelings.” She felt it in the scenes with Swinton as Martha in hospital, a recognition, and an understanding that while you might not be able to save someone, you can help simply by being there. She repeats the line, with weight: “There are lots of ways to live inside a tragedy,” whether a hospital room, a war, or a broken planet. “Life is hard, death is hard, sorrow is hard, grief, all of these things that we live with. You can’t say, ‘Oh, forget it. I withdraw.’ You have to be present with it. You live with it.” She nods. “This is what life is. We have children and we go to the movies and we talk like this. We persist!” We’re staring at each other now, a sort of mutual terror on the table between us, and I find myself apologising for asking questions about the horrors of being alive on such a fine morning and she chuckles merrily while pulling the band from her ponytail. “NoI’msorry,” she says. But, there’s always more than one thing happening at the same time, she reminds me – there’s always the tragedy, “the brutality”, as well as the beauty, and the quotidian reality of a woman’s working day. “Because, this entire time…” talking about, for instance, how to live when death is real, she smiles, “I’ve also been deep conditioning my hair.” The Room Next Door is in cinemas from 25 October",Eva Wiseman
spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/13/melania-trump-memoir-review,2024-10-13,Melania by Melania Trump review - a blame-dodging masterclass | Melania Trump | The Guardian,,"Melania Trump’s eponymously titled memoir is a 180-page exercise in buck-passing and blame-dodging. The former US first lady blames staffers for plagiarizing Michelle Obama; repeatedly stresses her love for her husband despite professing to abhor lying liars who lie; anddeclaresabortion afundamental right, without pausing to considerDonald Trump’s role in attacking it via the US supreme court. Melania is by no means an exhaustive read, but it does leave the reader asking why she has chosen to bare her soul just weeks before theelection. Or whetherKamala Harrismight more accurately channel her policy preferences than her husband, the Republican nominee yet again.  Many subjects are missing. Not surprisingly, Melania has nothing to say about other women in her husband’s life: E Jean Carroll (the woman Donald defamed andsexually assaulted); Stormy Daniels (the adult film star whose hush-money payments led to Donald’s criminalconviction); Karen McDougal (the former Playboy Playmate who alsohad an affairwith Donald). There are less than a handful of passing references to Ivanka, Donald’s oldest daughter who hesaidhe would have dated if she weren’t flesh and blood and who Melania is widelyreportedto loathe. Trump’s children by other women barely get a look-in. Melania does repeatedly say she loves her own son, Barron, and her parents too. True to form, no clue is offered as to who assisted in writing Melania. In contrast toBreaking History, the White House memoir by Jared Kushner, Ivanka’s husband, Melania does not offer acknowledgments. It’s a decent bet someone lent her a hand. Her book does contain 64 pages of photographs. The lead-off is a passport page, stamped on 27 August 1996 at JFK in New York, the day Melania arrived in the US. The final page includes a “digital collectible”, available frommelaniatrump.com. Like her husband, the brand is all. “Financial independence is a core value of mine,” Melania writes. “Melania Timepieces and Jewelry represented my passion, my project and my business – a symbol of independence, self-respect and empowerment for all women.” Understandably, Melania’s takes on policy have received more attention. Without mention ofDobbs v Jackson, the ruling by which a supreme court including three hardliners installed by Donald Trump gutted the constitutional right to abortion and privacy, her stand for personal freedom isfull-throated. “It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,” she thunders. “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.” Simply put, such words jar with her party’s record. And yet, another chapter is more telling still. Melania dumps on staffers for drafting the speech to the 2016 Republican convention in whichshe plagiarized Michelle Obama. Except Melania manages also to point the finger at herself. “During my review of many speeches of previous first ladies, Michelle’s emphasis on the fundamental values of hard work, integrity, and kindness resonated deeply,” she writes, of a conversation with the aide who wrote the speech. In other words, Melania shows she was familiar with Michelle Obama’s 2008 speech to the Democratic convention, portions of which she would repeat to Republicans in Cleveland in 2016. There’s more. Before speaking at the RNC, Melania “rehearsed multiple times with the teleprompter, feeling confident in my delivery”. And yet, she claims, when the plagiarism was noticed and a media firestorm blew up, she was shocked. “Upon closer examination, the undeniable similarities between the two speeches left me reeling.” Really? “I trusted that any and all political and legal vetting had been taken care of, but now I realized that the campaign and RNC had left me on my own.” Talk about throwing the staff under any passing bus. And yet, to quote the deathless words of Kimberly Guilfoyle, Don Jr’s fiancée: “The best is yet to come.” “‘Why was the speech not vetted?’, I asked Donald in frustration … From then on, I realized the importance of being intimately involved with every detail of my public life. No longer would I delegate specific tasks or trust others to ensure my reputation was protected.” Specifically, Melania blames Meredith McIver of the Trump Organization – to whom she says she herself read Michelle Obama’s words, words Melania then repeatedly practiced. As the saying goes, shit rolls downhill. When it comes to her husband, too, Melania is not in the blame game. The chaos ofJanuary 6is dealt with as swiftly as anything inconvenient that actually makes it to her pages. She wags her finger at those who assaulted the Capitol in an attempt to overturn Donald’s 2020 defeat but also claims to have been unaware of events for most of that terrible day. “The violence we witnessed was unequivocally unacceptable,” she writes. But in her next breath, she adds that she “recognized that many individuals felt the election was mishandled and that the vice president should halt the confirmation process”. Naturally, Melania’s take on protests following the murder of George Floyd is far more strident, complete with a condemnation of “the inflammatory rhetoric of Black Lives Matter leaders”. Indeed, she does not expressly name Floyd, the Minneapolis man whose murder by police triggered the long hot protest summer of 2020. As for her husband’s exhortation to the far-right Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” around the election, or his forecast of a “Big protest in DC on January 6th[,] Be there, will be wild!”, or his exhortation to followers to “fight like hell”? Crickets. Almost eight years have passed since Melaniareportedly cried in sorrowon election night 2016, when her husband won the White House. She could yet return. Maybe that will provide enough material for another 180 pages.",Lloyd Green
spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/13/my-partner-wants-more-sex-and-more-enthusiasm-from-me,,My partner wants more sex and more enthusiasm from me | Sex | The Guardian,,"The questionMy partner and I have been together for more than 15 years, and we have children. We share a great emotional connection, but sex has always been a sticking point. I have a lower sex drive; I enjoy thinking about sex as well as masturbating, and I have no difficulty reaching climax, I’m just frequently underwhelmedby sex with my partner.He, on the other hand, says that he feels desire for me and would like to have sex more often. However, he also regularly mentions he finds sex with me routine or disappointing and he would like me to act more enthusiastically. He feels rejected. Recently, we’ve tried to addressit by scheduling date nights, so he doesn’t have to worry about rejection and I don’t have to worry about feeling pressured on other nights – although he has made advances on non-date nights, whichhave contributed to the point I’ve now reached where I can no longer enjoy even non-sexual intimacy. I lovehim deeply, but I don’t know how to get out of this impasse. We’ve tried therapyand he’s said that talking didn’t seem to change things,and doesn’t want to rehash old conversations that don’t help. I’ve written a letter to him and it helped a little, at least it led to us adopting the scheduling system. But it’s too weird to keep writing to someone you live with.  Philippa’s answerIt sounds like the impasse may be that he doesn’t want to talk and you don’t want to have sex. And that if he could talk and listen and understand what page you are on, you might not be so averse to sex and, similarly, if he had all the sex he wanted, he might feel secure enough to talk. This is quite often where couples get stuck. True and lasting love isn’t all about the meeting of physical desires so much as it is about a profound understanding of each other’s vulnerabilities and an acceptance of the imperfections that come with them. Maybe he finds it makes him feel too vulnerable to have conversations about this face to face, so writing to him like you have done is a way forward, weird or not. Sexuality, in its mysterious and elusive nature, is not just about physical pleasure but is tied to our emotional landscape, to the unspoken and often unrecognised layers of our being. You mention a lower sex drive, but also a vibrant inner life where you enjoy thinking about sex, and masturbating. This suggests the issue may not lie in a waning of your sexuality, but in how it has been shaped by the dynamic between you and your partner. Has the expectation that you will be desirous and enthusiastic worn you down? Have you tried to meet his needs and in doing so perhaps started to lose sight of your own? Now, your body is rebelling. InThe Dance of Intimacy, Harriet Lerner describes the dynamic where one partner chases while the other retreats and then the roles reverse as a common and complex pattern in relationships. This “pursuer-distancer” cycle is a way both partners manage anxiety and emotional distance. I see you pursuing him, wanting a deeper emotional connection through talking and he runs away. He then pursues you, wanting the connection through sex, which makes you want to run away. When one partner chases, they may be seeking closeness, reassurance or connection, often driven by a fear of abandonment or emotional disconnection. The partner who retreats, on the other hand, might be feeling overwhelmed, which triggers their need for space or emotional distance. This retreat then increases the anxiety of the pursuer, causing them to chase more intensely which, in turn, makes the other partner retreat even further. This may account for you not tolerating non-sexual touching now. When the roles reverse, the one who was initially distancing may now feel the need for connection, perhaps out of fear of losing the relationship, while the original pursuer may become overwhelmed by the sudden closeness and feel the need for distance. Him not wanting to have any more conversations about it may be his way of displaying this. This push-pull dynamic often reflects deeper fears and unmet needs, which are being expressed through behaviour rather than being directly communicated. Instead of acting out of fear or anxiety, try to communicate directly. For example, if you’re feeling distant and need space, explain it’s not about rejecting him but about taking care of your own emotional wellbeing. The tendency is for us to take for granted the meanings we automatically assign to our partner’s actions or inactions, but these meanings need unpacking. The key to stopping this dance is for both partners to recognise the cycle and intentionally step out of it. And that, I’m sorry for his sake to have to say, means more conversation, which may be easier with an experienced couple’s therapist (cosrt.org.uk).

Some sanitised, cagey reminiscences, dutifully studded with anecdotes about her father, Elvis, the king of rock’n’roll, who died aged 42 in 1977? Instead, it’s a warts and all jaw-dropper. The marriages (including Michael Jackson and Nicolas Cage). The drugs (Lisa Marie spiralled into opioid addiction after a caesarean section to deliver her twins). And that’s before the revelations about her son Ben Keough’s 2020 suicide (she kept his body on dry ice in her California home for two months). When her actor daughter,Riley Keough(fromDaisy Jones &the Six), writes that she wants Lisa Marie to emerge from the pages of the memoir as a “three-dimensional character”, she’s not kidding. The book is co-authored by Keough from in-depth taped interviews with her mother just before her death aged 54 in 2023 (from cardiac arrest and a small bowel obstruction caused by complications from bariatric surgery). Keough’s own words appear throughout (in a different typeface), especially frequently towards the end.  First, though, we’re transported to Presley’s childhood as the overindulged princess of the Memphis, Tennessee mansion Graceland, with a hamburger-shaped bed and a plane named after her. A daddy’s girl, even after Elvis’s divorce from her mother, Priscilla, she would ride around the grounds in her own golf cart and threaten to get staff sacked. Elvis looms large in these passages: taking his daughter on a rollercoaster with a gun in a holster; shooting snakes in the grounds. He was a long-term prescription drug addict and Lisa Marie would sometimes find him passed out on the floor. She watched Elvis carried out of Graceland the day he died: “I saw his head, I saw his body, I saw his pyjamas, and I saw his socks at the bottom of the gurney.” She was nine years old. What would that do to a child? In subsequent years, she responded with the standard teenage cocktail of cynicism and rebellion: any drugs, bar heroin (“anything I could swallow, snort, eat, sniff”); terrible boyfriends, one of whom orchestrated a paparazzi set-up. She had howling insecurities as the daughter of the “king”. When Presley eventually made music, she resisted pressure to sound like her father. Nor did she feel close to her mother. Elvis met Priscilla when she was 14 (“it was a different time”, writes Lisa Marie, brusquely noting they didn’t have sex until her mother was 18). Priscilla springs from these pages like some southern belle ice queen. After Elvis’s death: “It was a one-two punch: he’s dead and I’m stuck with her.” When they both became Scientologists, Lisa Marie felt Priscilla was “dumping” her there. Later there was a truce, but you don’t sense a real reconciliation: “People think I’m a bitch because unfortunately I have my mom’s chilly thing.” Her healthiest relationship was with Riley and Ben’s father (Danny Keough), and they remained lifelong friends. While the Cage union is dealt with relatively swiftly and politely, the mid-90s marriage to Jackson gets the full candid treatment. She brushes aside the child molestation accusations (“I never saw a goddamn thing like that. I personally would’ve killed him if I had”). He told her he was a virgin (“He said Madonna had tried to hook up with him once, too, but nothing happened”) and was interested in her sexually (“He said: ‘I’m not waiting!’”). Later, Presley would start to doubt Jackson, who also had drug problems and his own anaesthetist. She also suspected he would dump her if she had his much-wanted children: “He was very controlling and calculating.” There is lots more going on too, as she succumbs to opioids, drifting in and out of rehab. But it’s the passages about her son’s body that make you wonder if you’re hallucinating (“I think it would scare the living fucking piss out of anybody else to have their son there like that. But not me”) – especially when she shows a tattooist the tattoo she wants by displaying it on Ben’s dead hand. Reading this, an uneasy thought occurs. Presley may have been happy to do the tapes, but would she have wanted itallpublished? We’ll never know. Certainly, it’s clear that Presley was nothing if not radically honest. It’s also striking how Keough seems to almost plead with the reader to understand and love her mother as much as she does. Ultimately, this is a book built on grief: Lisa Marie Presley’s for her father and son, but also a daughter’s for her mother.",Barbara Ellen

This was at a time when Tim Cahill’s heroics in Kaiserslautern, where Australia defeated Japan 3-1 at the 2006 World Cup, were still fresh in the memory. It’s a banner that stuck in the craw ofJapanese fans for many years. Cahill, as he had been in Germany, was Japan’s kryptonite again that night, scoring both of Australia’s goals in front of more than 74,000 fans. In the decade and a half since, however, the paths of the two countries have trended in very different directions. The shadow, as it was, now casts the other way. Since that meeting at the MCG, the record reads six wins to Japan, three draws, zero wins toAustralia.  “In 2006 I think it’s fair to sayJapanhad an inferiority complex when it came to playing against teams that had ‘famous’ players from the Premier League, and that endured with regards to Australia until the Asian Cup final in 2011,” Sean Carroll, author ofBetween The Lines: Navigating the world of Japanese Football,explained. “That win undoubtedly served as a watershed moment and gave Japan confidence in subsequent games against the Socceroos, and in the few meetings after that they went toe-to-toe with Australia to draw several times. The sands have shifted further into Japan’s favour in recent years. Not only are they now the superior side but they and Australia both know it.” In another universe Pete Cklamovski could’ve been coaching the Socceroos in their vital World Cup qualifier against Japan on Tuesday night at Saitama Stadium. The FC Tokyo boss was one of a small number of names linked with the post after Graham Arnold’s departure before Tony Popovic was ultimately handed the reins. The 45-year-old, a former long-time assistant of Ange Postecoglou at Melbourne Victory, the Socceroos and Yokohama F.Marinos, has worked in Japan since 2018 and credits their success to long-term planning. “They’ve got 60 professional clubs with all the resources for a player to be at their best, with funding and facilities and they stick to the plan. That’s a credit to the JFA and I think that’s a reason why they do things better than most countries in Asia.” The foundation for Japan’s modern day success, with a depth of talent the envy of the continent, is the domestic J. League, founded in 1993 and now boasting 60 teams across three divisions - all connected by promotion and relegation. The A-League, by comparison, still has only 13 teams and no prospect of an aligned second division on the horizon. “They were always looking at things with a mid- to long-term vision, rather than just simply hoping for immediate returns,” Carroll says. “That has allowed the growth to happen gradually over time. “While the J.League has, of course, had eras bringing in famous, fading foreign stars for big money there has always been a focus on producing homegrown talent, either in the high school, university, or J.League youth categories, and foreign quotas to ensure local players get opportunities to develop once in the top team. “The league has been expanded bit by bit over the years, creating and supplying demand in tandem, and ensuring that requirements for membership are, for the most part, achievable as clubs have taken their first steps up into J2, or now J3, from the semi-pro or amateur leagues.” Sign up toAustralia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter promotion That connected structure, all the way down to regional areas, is something Cklamovski would like to see Australia replicate. “I think there’s something to take from that to help our leagues - the A-League, the (second division), if that’s ever going to start, how the states can connect (with that) and have a promotion and relegation system in our own leagues one day. The stronger the leagues, the more players we can export. Then one day we can all dream of winning the World Cup.” Former Japan Football Association general secretary, Saburo Kawabuchi - credited as the brainchild of the J. League - described the league as: “...a social revolution, different from just making Japan good at football. “The Japanese had not experienced this kind of community-based sports club, because people didn’t know about them. The top people from government and industry had been abroad and knew about how good sports clubs were, but they didn’t think of setting them up in Japan. “They thought abroad is abroad and Japan is Japan, they are different.” Remember the ‘Football, but not as you know it?’ tagline? The A-League was Australia’s football revolution. But for myriad reasons, Australian football lost its compass, while Japan maintained theirs. The results, 30 years on, speak for themselves.",Paul Williams

The planned fourth race was cancelled as winds failed to reach the minimum 6.5 knots and will be held as a one-off on Monday. Weather permitting, the two-race schedule will resume on Wednesday. Britain’s Ineos team may feel relieved that Sunday’s second race was cancelled after a New Zealand display of superiority over the first three races that the ­Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo described as “almost insulting”.  On the second day of the showdown, race three proved to be pretty much a replica of the first two contests. On a fine, warm day with a light north-easterly wind of 7-10 knots, once again the Emirates Team New ­Zealand boat made an aggressive and better start and quickly ­established a comfortable lead. The two boats almost collided at the start line, for which the British team paid with a 75-metre penalty for failing to keep clear. By the end of the first stage, New Zealand were 150m ahead, extending their lead to 400m by the fourth leg before crossing the line with more than 600m of clear water, 52 seconds ahead of Ineos Britannia, having led at every stage. At each turn they seemed to have better acceleration than their rivals. Asked about the manoeuvre at the start line Peter Burling, the New ­Zealand captain, said the team had been “working on little bits and pieces”, adding: “We tried it yesterday and they just got past us. It was uncomfortable how close the boats got but it was great to finally execute it in a race, to make it count.” Ray Davies, the New Zealand coach, said: “It was an awesome moment that we’ve been practising a lot. It was great to see a bit of match racing creeping in. Ben [Ainslie, the British captain] has been asking for someone to do it for quite a long time. It was good that it was us who gave him one of those.” Ainslie believed his team’s ­penalty at the start was a tough call. “It felt like we were keeping clear but the umpires didn’t see it that way,” he said, adding that he accepted the decision. The general view is that, technically, there is little to choose between the British and New Zealand boats and that it is the drivers that count. On this showing, New Zealand’s are simply better than Britain’s. “We’re under no illusions,” Burling said. “They’re an amazing team and they’re going to be putting together a hell of a fight, so we’re expecting a battle every race, but we’re definitely up for it.” People in Barcelona have been largely indifferent to a competition in which racing started two months ago, and the boats have been ­visible in the port since the start of the year. However, there have been signs that America’s Cup fever is finally ­beginning to catch on. The fan zones were packed on Sunday, with British fans heavily outnumbered by New ­Zealand supporters, many wearing the ETNZ team shirt. In addition ­dozens of boats, large and small, crowded around the edges of the race area to give fans a closer look. By no means is everyone in Barcelona happy about the competition being staged here, though, and opposition has been building over recent months. Two hours before racing began on Sunday thousands of people – 10,000 according to the organisers – joined a protest organised by the “No to the America’s Cup” campaign, which is supported by about 140 local and community organisations. after newsletter promotion Protesters say that holding these prestigious events benefits only the wealthy and contributes to ­rising housing costs, pricing residents out of their homes. The campaign is also bringing a case to the anti-fraud office on the grounds that the ­organisers allegedly made false and grossly inflated claims about the ­economic benefits to the city of ­hosting the event. Technically speaking, the racing could continue for another week, but the British team know that they will have to up their game if they do not want to find themselves heading home on Friday on the losing end of a 7-0 scoreline. “We know there’s a long way to go in this competition, we just keep pushing hard,” said Ainslie, whose phlegmatic nature has been put to the test these past 48 hours.",Stephen Burgen

I’m proud of myself and I thank God for the victory and the world record,” Chepngetichtold NBC Chicago after the race. “This is my dream that has come true. I fight a lot thinking about world record and I have fulfilled it and I’m much grateful.” It was obvious from early on that Chepngetich’s race, in which she averaged 4:57.4 per mile, would be a special one. She ran the first five kilometres in just 15 minutes, and completed the first half of the course in 1:04:16, which would have been the fifth-fastest women’s half-marathon of all time. The victory earned her $100,000 and she won another $50,000 for breaking the course record. Chepngetich’s compatriot, John Korir, won the men’s race in 2:02:44, ahead of Huseydin Mohamed Esa of Ethiopia, who finished in 2:04:39. Korir and Chepngetich ran in honor of the late Kelvin Kiptum ofKenya, who broke the men’s world record at the 2023 Chicago Marathon. “The world record has come back to Kenya,” Chepngetich said. “I dedicate this world record to Kelvin Kiptum.” In February the 24-year-old Kiptum and his coach, Gervais Hakizimana,died in a car accident. Police said Kiptum lost control of his vehicle before hitting a tree near a training area in Kaptagat, Kenya. Organizers held a moment of silence for Kiptum before the race and offered the nearly 50,000 runners a memorial sticker to add to their bibs.",Guardian sport

After the mayhem of the Wembley defeat against Greece on Thursday night and all of the fallout, chiefly the uncertainty around his longer-term role within theEnglandsetup, this was a return to the tranquil progress of his first camp in September. It was a stroll against a limited Finland team, the whipping boys of thisNations Leaguegroup, England not exactly wowing but doing more than enough to position the Greece loss a little further back in the rearview mirror. It is now three wins out of four for Carsley, after those against Republic of Ireland in Dublin and Finland at Wembley.  The standout moment came when Trent Alexander-Arnold bent home a sumptuous free-kick from a position to the left of centre, wafting his right foot like a wand to make it 2-0. England had given up chances in the first half and a big one after the break,Finlandwasting them and there was always the sense that Carsley’s team had higher gears to find if needed. They were not. Jack Grealish has enjoyed himself under Carsley. This was his third start under him and he opened the scoring with a cool finish after a lovely flick from Angel Gomes. Declan Rice got the third from a cross by Ollie Watkins, on as a substitute, and Finland’s late consolation, Arttu Hoskonen running free to head home from a corner, was little more than a minor irritation for England. The Carsley Question was a major theme – in terms of where he will go at the end of his interim tenure in November. Answer: back to his old job with the under-21s. It is absolutely the most likely outcome. The other big subject had concerned the style of his team. The botched all-out attack against Greece had given the red tops the dream headline – Kami-Carsley – and it was always going to be more conventional here, not only because Harry Kane was back from injury to play as the No 9. England had dominated against Finland at Wembley in Carsley’s second game, creating so many chances and it was a night when control was the theme. The idea was for more of the same; hence the recall for Gomes alongside Rice in midfield. It was Gomes who picked the lock for the breakthrough goal, who found a way through Finland’s compact 5-4-1 system. It had all been a little too mannered at the outset, England measured in terms of tempo. They had all of the ball; it was patience over passion. Grealish injected the urgency, surging off the left to find Alexander-Arnold and dart for the area. What a lovely assist it would be from Gomes. He knew where Grealish was and when he accepted the ball from Alexander-Arnold in between the lines, he turned it neatly through for Grealish, who had only Lukas Hradecky to beat. The Finland goalkeeper had been a titan at Wembley. Grealish simply opened up his body for the sidefoot finish and the sucking-thumb celebration for his recently born baby girl. He looked determined to embrace a more familiar role on the left wing, having previously been played by Carsley in more central areas. There were imperfections from England in the first-half, including when they attempted to build from the back; a few loose passes. Gomes was guilty of one in the early running at 0-0, giving the ball away and watching Finland work it to Benjamin Källman, John Stones jumping into an important block when he shot. On the rebound, Topi Keskinen dragged wide. Twice before the interval, Stones went stride-for-stride with first Keskinen and then Källman and on both occasions, the Finland player was able to unload. Dean Henderson, making his full England debut, saved easily. There was also a worry about Finland getting in on the blindside of Alexander-Arnold, who Carsley played at left-back. When Nikolai Alho did so in the 38th minute, he headed square for Fredrik Jensen, who got a break past Alexander-Arnold before lashing off target. Sign up toFootball Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Rice had the sniff of a chance for 2-0 on 34 minutes when he took a decent first touch in the area from a floated Jude Bellingham pass and saw Matti Peltola miss his kick. Just as quickly as the close-range shooting opportunity presented itself, Robert Ivanov got back to shut the door. Marc Guehi slid over from left centre-half to make a back three when Alexander-Arnold sortied into midfield. But a word for Guehi’s defending: commanding. He won a clutch of duels in the first-half, and always looked like doing so. It was a worry when Stones was one-on-one with his man. When Finland moved the ball left for Keskinen in the 57thminute, Stones could not prevent the low cross. It ran all the way through for Jensen, who lifted high from point-blank range. It was an almighty let-off. It felt like a slog, at times, for England in creative terms. Bellingham was often frustrated in his attempts to use his twinkle toes to jink through while Cole Palmer got little Bellingham is not the type of guy to hide. He continued to demand the ball, to try his moves and when he hoodwinked the Finland substitute, Leo Walta, into stretching in for a tackle, he felt the contact and went down for the free-kick. Grealish told Alexander-Arnold he would give him £500 if he scored. The goal felt priceless to Carsley.",David Hytner

The Erebus driver fended off red-hot Red Bull star Feeney in the six-hour marathon at Mount Panorama on Sunday to win Australia’s biggest domestic motorsport prize.  The reigning Supercars champion is the first driver since Chaz Mostert in 2021 to win from pole. Feeney and his co-driver Jamie Whincup were second-fastest, ahead of Red Bull teammates Will Brown and Scott Pye in third. “I just can’t believe it. I’m in awe at the moment,” Kostecki said. “Broc was breathing down my neck the whole time. It was just balls to the walls the whole time. “It’s kind of funny around here. If you bring your pace back a little bit, you can actually get yourself into trouble. “I just knew that if I just did shootout laps every single lap, I knew I wouldn’t make a mistake. “It’s redemption from last year, for sure.” A year on from fumbling the grid’s top spot at Mount Panorama, Kostecki held his nerve on Sunday against numerous fierce passing attempts from second-rower Feeney to lead for the opening 28 laps, before handing over to co-driver Todd Hazelwood. He looked certain to be crowned the King of the Mountain with little challenge, until a Matt Payne crash resulted in the only safety car and a full course reset after almost five hours. With the entire grid boasting fresh tyres and 28 laps to go, the Western Australian proved his mettle by fending off Feeney in a sprint showdown to the finish line. He won by just 1.35 seconds. Such was Feeney’s pace that the 21-year-old took the fastest lap of the race, with a time of two minutes 7.861 seconds. “I drove my heart out out there. I didn’t leave anything on the table,” Feeney said. “These guys next to me, Brodie and Todd, absolutely killed it today – they were faultless. “We’ll be back one day. We’ll get up on the top step.” It is a career-first Bathurst 1000 win from six attempts for Kostecki and from eight attempts for Hazelwood. The win is also Kostecki’s first of the season after a messy off-season legal dispute with Erebus disrupted his title defence.

Feeney and Whincup did find some redemption in their second-place result after their last attempt at the mountain ended in tears. The pair experienced gearbox issues in lap 137 when they were placed second before finishing 23rd last year. It is the best Bathurst finish for Feeney from five attempts, but Whincup’s attempt to break his 12-year-long Bathurst drought fell just short.

Australian Rugby League Commission chair Peter V’landys now has good reason to believe them. AnNRLexpansion bid by North Sydney’s Perth-based “franken-club” the Western Bears to join the NRL ultimately failed to impress the rugby league tsar, who now faces a race against time to prove to broadcasters his code is worth as much – or more – than the AFL. It was an astonishing development in a process that until now seemed pre-ordained. A timeline towards 20 clubs within the next five-year broadcast cycle appeared straightforward, with as many as 11 parties reportedly interested from everywhere between Perth and Christchurch.  But nobody, not even “Saint Peter” himself, wields more power than the clubs. The ARLC must convince three quarters of them of the merits of the expansion proposal. The Bears may have cut-through with nostalgic New South Wales rugby league fans, but officials in clubland have no such attachment. Rather, they might generously be described as pragmatic. The Bears’ submission failed to include the offer to the NRL of a licence fee – a sugar hit which could help the NRL placate the clubs – prompting V’landys to declare the business case didn’t stack up. The bid instead combines Perth corporate and government support and the knowhow and infrastructure of the North Sydney club (which still plays in the second-division NSW Cup). The Western Bears bid is now “on life support” according to consortium member Peter Cumins, the Cash Converters executive deputy chairman, who refuses to write the NRL a blank cheque. “We’ve got to be very conscious of the fact that if there is a [licence] fee to be paid and it’s significant, we’ve got to make sure we can honour the commitment that we make.” The Bears can point to the example of the Dolphins, which were not required to pay a licence fee when they joined the NRL two years ago. Federal member for Bradfield in Sydney’s northern suburbs, Paul Fletcher, this week told the NRL in parliament to “get on with it” and don’t use “vaguely described financial considerations” to block the Bears’ return to the elite level. Western Australian premier Roger Cook is part of the push for the Western Bears. “We continue to discuss aspects of the bid process,” Cook said, confirming that he had exchanged text messages with V’landys since the decision. “Obviously, the bids went in. I think ours was the strongest. But we need to address some of the issues the board had concerning that bid,” he said. Rugby league in Australia is in a healthy state, with clubs seemingly free of financial turmoil and the NRL reporting a $58m operating surplus on revenue of more than $700m in 2023. Yet health in Australian sport is a relative thing. The AFL signed a $4.5 billion with Channel Seven and Foxtel in 2022 which kicks in next season. At around $640m per season, it far surpasses the NRL’s current arrangement which is estimated a little over $400m annually, even though the NRL outperforms AFL on a range of ratings metrics. Sign up toAustralia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter promotion Although the NRL’s current TV deal runs until 2027, V’landys and chief executive Andrew Abdo will soon ramp up discussions with broadcasters. In an increasingly challenging commercial TV landscape, the NRL’s most straightforward path for a broadcast bump is through increasing its volume of content. Adding one more team would allow nine NRL games each weekend, and if Perth was included it would open up another option for an evening match broadcast on the east coast. But more games might not be best for the product. The Rugby League Players Association has resisted any increase to the length of the season, and the effort to tack on internationals in spring is already forcing the game’s best players to play more than 30 matches each year. At theNRLWlaunch this season, Abdo said expansion would allow flexibility in scheduling and potentially even a reduction in rounds. The by-product of this week’s drama is the transformation of the Papua New Guinea bid. What was once risky is now the closest thing V’landys has to a sure thing. The proposal includes a $600m, ten-year commitment from the federal government, including – significantly – a $60m license fee that will beshared among the clubs. $29m each year will be budgeted for the football team, and another $25m per year will go towards programs jointly run by the NRL and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade designed to improve education and living standards in the region. The PNG government has committed to building the club’s accommodation and training base and providing income tax exemptions worth several million dollars per year to make living in Port Moresby more attractive to players. “There are a few more regulatory processes to complete before an official announcement can be made,” Prime Minister James Marape said this week, ahead of Sunday’s Prime Minister’s XIII exhibition matches. “As PNG approaches our 50th next year, it will be a good golden jubilee gift.” An announcement on NRL expansion is expected by the end of November.",Jack Snape

The former tradie turned endurance athlete was in agony – and frequently, in tears. By 5pm on the 10th night, Brockmann, 25, from the New South Wales central west, had covered 1,322.62km. He had run every day for 16-20 hours a day around a 400-metre athletics track. He had raised over $1.3m in donations for charity. But his body was failing him.  “Nedd has been in pain every day of this challenge,” said support team leader James Ward. “He’s got issues with his shins, knees, shoulders. It’s got to the point where he needs us to put him in a wheelchair every morning to get him on the track. But so long as the donations keep coming in, he thinks all the pain is worthwhile.” By Sunday, the blisters on Brockmann’s feet were raw and bleeding. Despite wearing shoes three sizes too large to combat the discomfort, there were times he could barely walk, let alone run, in his effort to meet the astonishing target of four marathons every day. “It is so relentless that track … it has been hell … and that’s why I love it,” Brockmann told his followers in a social media clip. By then his “Uncomfortable Challenge” had drawn 2.7m views to TikTok for what did prove uncomfortable – yet undoubtedly inspiring – footage. Brockmann had his eyes on a record set by the greatest ultra runner of all time,Yiannis Kouros, who ran 1,000 miles in 10 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes and 36 seconds in New York in 1988. It was a typically audacious target and, by Sunday, it looked out of reach. But with the crowd cheering from the bleachers, Brockmann soldiered on. “The record might be out of reach for Nedd but he’s not stopping,” said Ward, who met Brockmann in 2020 when the 21-year-old sparkie ran 50 marathons in 50 days to raise more than $100,000 for the Red Cross. “Nedd is an incredible character. When he hit $1.3m in donations today he burst into tears. Then he kept on running.” Brockmann first captured the hearts of the nation in 2022 with an extraordinary 46-day run of 4,000km across Australia that raised $1.85m forWe Are Mobilise, an outreach program combatting homelessness. Six weeks after he set off in Western Australia, a crowd of over 10,000 people cheered the cult hero across the line at Bondi beach. This challenge was shorter but steeper – and far more gruelling. “Yiannis Kouros’s feat of endurance is simply mindblowing,” Brockmann had written on Instagram ahead of setting out. “However, if you’re going to do something, don’t go in half-assed, throw everything at it.

Brockmann has been mostly running at night to avoid the heat, and sleeping by day, and stuck to a strict refuelling schedule. His mother, Kylie, and father, Ian, have been cheering his every step, and boxing champion Harry Garside and comedian Hamish Blake have turned up at the track to run beside him. Sign up toAustralia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter promotion On day eight, with with the record slipping away, Brockmann changed tactics. Instead of tackling each 100-mile (161.1km) in 20-hour blocks virtually non-stop over a day, he began to work in “17-hour sessions”: running big miles, resting a few hours, then going again. With 12 hours to go, Brockmann needed to run 280km by Monday 14 October at 3:30am AEST (and 35 seconds) to claim the world record. But the record paled before the higher cause of raising money for the homeless. “He’s had 20,000 individual donations so far, mostly Mums and Dads and kids, rather than big corporations,” reckons Ward. “He’ll keep going into Tuesday, even Wednesday, until he hits 1,000.” Beyond 1,000, Brockmann is encouraging workplaces, schools, gyms and groups of friends to embark on their ownuncomfortable challengefor charity in coming weeks. “This isn’t just about endurance or attempting to break a world record – I want it to be a rallying cry for people who want to have a crack, to stand together, and make a difference,” Brockmann said.

For the fourth time in 16 years, Beijing has been spooked by faltering growth into adopting anarray of economic stimulus measuresdesigned to reset the economy. It didn’t work for long in 2008, 2015 or 2021, and the “bazooka” measures announced recently will also most likely come up short.  These programmes have failed in the past because the government’s focus is mainly on the cyclical – or short-term – outlook. It thinks quick palliatives are the answer to systemic problems such as high youth unemployment, the real estate bust, weak productivity and deflation. China’s problems, however, require structural – or root and branch – economic reforms, which necessitate political changes that are anathema to its Leninist government. The government has certainly managed to set the stock market alight, and it hopes that renewed confidence will spill over into consumer spending. After a relentlessdecline of about 40%since early 2021, the late September package of stock market support, monetary easing and housing measures triggered a roughly 30% rise in equity values in the week before the recent Golden Week holiday. The centrepiece was 800bn yuan (£86bn) worth of financing facilities allowing listed firms to buy back their own shares, and non-bank financial firms to buy equities. The authorities lowered interest rates on market instruments and mortgages, banks’ reserve requirements, and the minimum downpayment on second homes. They increased the subsidy to state enterprises to buy unfinished homes, whichloom heavilyover the real estate market. The stock of unsold homes, disproportionately situated in smaller towns and cities, is estimated to amount to about three to four years of sales at current rates. Stock market sentiment has cooled since. While direct equity market intervention and easier monetary conditions bring relief, they do little to address deep-seated economic flaws. Most of the measures announced were either extensions or variants of pre-existing policies that haven’t had great traction. China is in a so-called liquidity trap, where cutting interest rates is not really effective. It is quite likely that stock market gains will dissipate unless the authorities act to improve the sustainability of the economic growth, and company earnings. Confidence is important, but the bulk of household wealth resides not in stocks but in the beleaguered property market where prices are falling, and in low-yielding bank deposits. Therefore, confidence to spend requires a more stable property market, stronger income growth and a more robust jobs market. There were expectations over the weekend that a hastily convened finance ministry press conference would address the issue. In the event, there wereno significant measures, and no details or numbers about how budgetary policy would be used to bolster the economy over the coming year. The finance minister said government borrowing would rise for the rest of this year and that local governments, responsible for public goods and services, would be encouraged to use about 2.3tn yuan of borrowed but unspent funds. They would also be allowed to borrow to buy unused land and unsold properties, while Beijing would authorise debt swaps with local governments and fund new capital injections into large state banks. These measures could help China to get closer to its 5% GDP target for this year. However, there could be additional fiscal easing in coming months, especially if the economy remains lacklustre as winter approaches, as seems likely. Overall, though, the government still seems focused on financial engineering within the state sector, rather than fundamental reform. The economy may benefit from as yet unspecified measures in 2025, but it is still going to slow down under the influence of misallocation of capital, limited debt capacity, long-term decline in the property sector, and weakness in household income and spending. There is little question thatXi Jinpingis prepared to tweak the government’s overall policy stance, but his reform agenda is quite different from the one that economists favour, both in China and the west. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion A solution would involve the sustainable expansion of the income and consumer demand shares of the economy, an end to deflation risk, more income redistribution, the promotion of private enterprise, and extensive tax and local government reforms. Xi’s more Leninist agenda emphasises supply and production, and what he calls “high-quality development”, which is essentially about state- and party-led industrial policies to allocate capital to lead and dominate modern science, technology and innovation in the global system. There is no doubt that China already has and wants to expand advanced industrial expertise and leadership in some key firms and sectors. Yet these islands of technological dominance exist in a sea of macroeconomic imbalances and troubles, which can only really be addressed by more liberal and open economic reforms. The current focus on economic policy is important not for some decimal points on GDP but as a signal as to whether the government can, or wants to, grasp the nettle.",George Magnus

In an effort to boost demand, Emmanuel Macron’s government introduced a social leasing scheme allowing less well-off commuters to pay an affordable monthly rate for a new electric vehicle (EV). Within a month, demand boomed to the extent that the scheme wasabruptly suspended. According to ministers, French carmakers couldn’t keep up with the sudden surge of interest. This autumn, companies such as Renault and Peugeot are facing a different kind of problem. Governments across the EU havewithdrawn subsidies and incentives, and are failing to provide reassuring levels of investment in charging infrastructure and grid capacity. As a consequence, EV sales are badly off the pace in the journey to 2035 zero-emission targets. According to new data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, August recorded thefourth consecutive monthly drop in sales. Overall, car sales are at their lowest for three years, with double-digit falls in France, Germany and Italy. Executives at Volkswagen, a symbol of Germany’s industrial prowess, have declared an intention toclose domestic factoriesfor the first time in the company’s history.  Along with the cost of living crisis, and the relatively high price of EVs, a big part of the problem iscompetition from China. State subsidies and access to essential battery materials are allowing Chinese manufacturers to significantly undercut European companies, and just as importantly, to dominate their huge domestic market. The stakes could not be higher. If the travails of flagship national brands and economic powerhouses such as VW are not addressed, far-right parties such as the Alternative für Deutschland will be given further scope to attack green targets as a menace to national prosperity. Recognising the crisis, the European Commission is planning to imposeheavy tariffs on Chinese EVsafter a year-long anti-subsidy investigation. This route, however, will create its own problems. A trade war with China will inevitably have damaging  consequences for European exporters. That’s why Germany has opposed the planned tariffs. And taking action to keep cheap Chinese EVs out of the European market will do nothing to boost consumer demand – in a sector fundamental to the green transition. In the face of farmer protests, the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has alreadyretreated on some of the climate targetsthat defined her first term. As the next phase of the transition seeks to decarbonise essential elements of everyday life, including the cars we drive, going green needs to be seen as affordable for consumers, including the less well-off, and as a source of economic renewal and growth for European businesses and regions. Brussels and proactive national governments should take the lead through a combination of subsidies and investment at scale to sustain industry and consumer confidence. This was the spirit of ananalysis of Europe’s economic prospectsby Mario Draghi, the former European Central Bank president, published last month. Yet as the EU reintroduces tight fiscal rules on national spending, the trajectory of policy is being determined by a shortsighted focus on balancing the books. Without a change of approach, the woes of the car industry are likely to deepen as it negotiates an era-defining transition.",Editorial

opinion,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/13/can-you-resist-all-the-addictions-modern-life-throws-at-you-only-if-youre-rich-enough,,Can you resist all the addictions modern life throws at you? Only if you’re rich enough | Martha Gill | The Guardian,,"They are problems of success, really, these modern ills. Social media addiction, gaming disorders, the compulsive over-eating of sugar and processed gloop: they are products of a society with more than enough food, leisure time and boredom, and without the life-or-death excitement that kept our ancestors busy. We could perhaps think of our rising addiction problems as something like a peacock’s tail or companionable parasite – the costly signal that we no longer need to strain every nerve to stay alive. Only a species that is this superfluously good at survival could afford to hack its own anti-survival neural circuitry, targeting the pathways that instead make it more likely to die. Problems of success are harder, not easier, to deal with, of course – you wouldn’t want to reverse the conditions that got us here. Releasing wolves back among us is not the right policy for tacklingTikTok-addled teens. But the troubling fact is that a large portion of the economy now runs on addiction.  The path of incentives is easy to trace: an addicted customer is a reliable customer – and why settle for mere consumption of your product when you could get overconsumption instead? The academic David Courtwright calls this “limbic capitalism”: named for the part of the brain responsible for emotional processing. Global industries, he says, are starting to aim right at it. In this country, we are at last regulating away some of the older vices, such asnicotine and alcohol. It has been tricky enough to do – vast industries and realms of addicts have staunchly opposed it for decades. But many new vices are popping up in their stead. Food companies mine and refine their products for addictive properties:ultra-processed food, thought to encourage compulsive eating, now makes uptwo-thirds of the calorie intakeof adolescent Britons.Gaming addiction is soaring. We hear less about workaholics than we used to, but perhaps only because the condition is so common – instead, we hear about burnout, the end result. Then of course there aresmartphones, teaching us to crave for the next ping of a message, or the bright notification of a retweet. These in turn link us to the thousands of addictive products being pumped out by the largest tech companies on the planet. There are gambling apps, gaming apps and one-click shopping apps – even addiction to fitness-tracker apps is on the rise. Then of course there is social media, to which almost half of British teensnow feel addicted. But above this inevitable nightmare of compulsive working, compulsive eating and compulsive clicking, floats another kind of life. For a few, it is possible to buy your way out, back into old-fashioned reality. As the modern world claws its way further into our limbic systems, a new kind of luxury is emerging: freedom from cravings. The ultimate example might be the rapid growth of semaglutide drugs (originally developed for treating diabetes). These are primarily used to help with diabetes and weight loss but, as they have surged in popularity, doctors and patients have begun to notice something else: they also seem toreduce cravings for alcohol, nicotine and opioids, and perhaps even compulsive gambling and online shopping. This makes sense to researchers, although studies on the phenomenon are still scarce: semaglutides such as Wegovy and Ozempic reduce the release of dopamine in the brain’s striatum, the region that motivates you to take another bite of something delicious but also to take another puff of your cigarette. They appear to act not on the digestive system, but on craving itself. For their users, then, an alternate reality beckons: you can walk through the blinking lights of modern life and your mind will remain your own. It’s hard to imagine – having a smartphone without needing to check it, putting down a tube of Pringles halfway through. For this is the major struggle of modern life: self-control in the face of addictive products. It’s becoming harder and harder to do. But this is also one place that a class divide is forming. Not everyone should take semaglutides, of course – the side-effects are still being uncovered – but most cannot afford to anyway. You can get Wegovy on the NHS, but only if you are morbidly obese, with a BMI of 35 and a serious weight-related condition such as hypertension – although in exceptional cases the merely obese, those with a BMI of at least 30, might qualify. Meanwhile, Ozempic is mostly known as a “Hollywood phenomenon”,available only to the rich. The income divide is there, too, when it comes to resisting online addictions. As time away from screens becomes a scarce commodity, some companies are monetising it in the form of off-griddigital detox weekendsor curiously expensivedumbphones. after newsletter promotion As are schools. In September, a private school in Cambridge started marketing itself as Britain’s first “screen-free school”: no mobile phones, no internet, no laptops and no interactive whiteboards. (Several parents work for tech giants with research centres in the city.) This summer, Eton announced it wouldban smartphones– giving new pupilsNokia “bricks”instead. Meanwhile, children from lower-income backgrounds spend on averagetwo more hours a day on their phonesthan their peers. This runs alongside the fact that money shelters you from many of the conditions that encourage addiction in the first place. Junk food appeals most when you do not have the time, money or the emotional energy to access healthy alternatives: chasing their likely customers, fast food jointsspring up in deprived areas. As do betting shops. With endlessly long NHS waiting lists for therapy or rehabilitation, getting treatment for addiction can be unaffordable too. We sometimes pretend that resisting gambling, social media, sweet treats and retail therapy is mostly a matter of willpower – as if the economy weren’t built on pushing us these things. Instead, it’s becoming a privilege few can afford.",Martha Gill
opinion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/howard-jacobson-gaza-israel-cruelty-louise-adler,,"Dear Howard Jacobson, don’t let historical hatreds cover Israel’s cruelty | Louise Adler | The Guardian",,"I write more in sorrow than in anger. You’ve acknowledged that we are a “disputatious people” so I know you will take this response in the spirit in which it is offered. I have relished every book you’ve written since your very first novel,Coming from Behind, was published in 1983. Much of your writing has resonated: your acuity about campus politics, your refusal to disavow, nay your pride, in your particular ethnic version of the Mancunian working class and your fine satirical instincts.  Unlike your first editor, the late Carmen Callil, I don’t object to your “masculinist” point of view. If your special subject seems to be the penis who am I to argue? Howard, in my favourite of all your books,Roots Schmoots, you acknowledge that Our People are “smitten with their own tragedy”. But that tragedy and your smittenness seem to have overwhelmed your capacity for empathy for the other contemporary tragedy – that of the Palestinian right to self-determination and sovereignty. Yourlatest jeremiadargues that antisemitism is the ur-racism, exceptional and eternal. I share your alertness to antisemitism. My mother was regularly called Mrs Goldberg. I said nothing when a chair of a publishing company I led asked whether a P&L statement was “Jewish accounting”. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve watched people tapping the side of their noses to suggest shrewdness, a nose for making a deal. However, I am surprised that “our” tragedy has left you unable to recognise that the occupation has morally corrupted Israeli society, that successive Israeli governments have colluded to oppress Palestinians, destroy their lives, their homes, and ensured the impossibility of any prospect of justice or peace. You suspect the western media of propaganda when, in reality, there has been a remarkable lack of representation of life inGazasince 7 October. I’m not sure where you were last weekend but the epic column inches devoted to the Israeli victims of 7 October does not suggest a failure to give due regard to their suffering. Indeed, what was almost entirely missing, or at best appeared as an afterthought, was any attention to the consequence of that day for Palestinians. This isn’t a call for both-siderism – I take Jacqueline Rose’s (one of your Ashamed Jews) view that “balance is a corrupt term in an unbalanced world”. One should not ignore the horror of theatrocities committed on 7 Octoberin the left-wing kibbutzim that Netanyahu and his cronies assiduously and cynically ignored for the last 15 years, nor should one ignore the nightmare for families who await, with dread, news of loved ones still held hostage in Gaza. But Howard, I wonder how you can push to one side the 40,000-plus Gazans murdered in the last 12 months because you’re preoccupied by what you describe as that most ancient hatred. You write, “it is hateful to be accused of what you haven’t done, but more hateful still to be accused of what you would never dream of doing and what you cannot bear to see done”.I wonder whether perhaps you hadn’t noticed the TikTok efforts of proud IDF soldiers, the religious fundamentalist settlers’ brutal treatment of Palestinians, who Yoav Gallant calls “ human animals”, or the obscene crimes against Palestinians prisoners at Sde Teiman prison in a state that promotes itself as the only democracy in the region. The evidence seems to refute your high-minded idea of Jewish people as incapable of barbarism. You seamlessly conflate Jewish­ness and Israel. I assume for you that connection is obvious as it is for the majority of diaspora Jews. So I assume you don’t mind being held accountable for the actions of the current government, given your essay evidences no dissent. However, if you are uncomfortable with the reality of the Israeli state today, then perhaps you should reconsider your allegiance to Zionism – rather than asking to enjoy your nightly viewing without being exposed to its deadly manifestation in the form of maimed babies, among other things. Almost as ancient as the hatred that preoccupies you is the rhetorical question: will this war on Gaza be good for the Jews? I think not. Louise Adler is a former publisher",

Instead,they saidyeah, nah.  And now we are stuck in a political purgatory. The voice proposal had been decades, some might say more than a century, in the making.It was born in the ashesof the decision by the former prime minister John Howard, backed by the Mark Latham-led ALP, to abolish the flawed but retrievable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Without Atsic’s input, theNorthern Territory interventionsoon followed, then the former prime minister Tony Abbott’sdemolition of Indigenous programs. It is little wonder that older First Nations people, who had lived with the consequences of bad policy all their lives, wanted a way of being assured that their families would not always be subject to political whim in a nation where race-baiting is a go-to political tool. They and their advisers thought – wrongly, as it turned out – that the Australian people would be more empathetic than their political leaders. In the land ofyeah, nah,change is hard-won. Many welcomedthe boldness of victorious prime minister Anthony Albanese’s promise to implement the Uluru statement from the heart “in full”. We then watched with increasing concern as he failed to build more robust foundations for the undoubtedly difficult task of constitutional change. Rather than explaining how the voice would not only respond to an entreaty, butbenefit all of us – how it would correct historical wrongs and provide a pathway forward, by building bipartisan support, or introducing legislation that would put muscle on the bones of an idea – the first memorable event was a photo op with the towering Americanbasketballer Shaquille O’Neal. Not Patty Mills or Ash Barty, not Adam Goodes or Johnathan Thurston, not Deborah Mailman, Ernie Dingo or Evonne Goolagong Cawley – stars Australians know and admire. Stars for whom it was personal. If you are going to put a match to your political capital, you need to make sure,as Tim Walz says, that the fire is so big that something better emerges, like a phoenix from the ashes. Instead, as the embers of the uncontrolled burn still spark, we are stuck in retreat. Nothing substantial has happened for First Nations people, the republic has been jettisoned, and the consequences of inequality at home and geopolitical uncertainty escalate. It’s not helped by an opposition leader who channels his inner toddler to saynahto everything despite parental reasoning. To give him the right of veto by demanding bipartisan support for any initiative is a recipe for sinking deeper into the mud. These are complex problems. Resolving them demands hard work and analytical, rhetorical and political skill. And imagination, informed by a knowledge of history. Those in Canberra work hard, are analytical and politically tactical, but miss on the other markers.The prime minister was mistakenwhen he saidthere was nothing to be gained by raking over the ashes of the referendum. There are lessons to be learned from its failure and from the past on how to turn the land ofyeah, nahinto a nation that embraces meaningful progress. When in 1889 the New South Wales governor Lord Carrington challenged premier Henry Parkes tocreate a single nation from the six antipodean colonies, Parkes thought it could be done within a year. It took 11, and two referenda in each colony beforeyeah, nahbecamenah, yeah. By then Parkes was dead. We tend to downplay federation and ignore its lessons. But earnest debate across the continent proceeded for a decade. It showed how persistence, argument and a willingness to compromise could produce results.

Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Saturday morning after newsletter promotion For more than a decade after 1901, even with the race-based policies we now reject, Australia was otherwise a global poster child for democratic innovation. Politicians, thinkers and journalists took the long sea journey and then travelled extensively to see what lessons could be learned and applied elsewhere. Universal franchise, living wages, pensions for menandwomen, compulsory free secular education. Recapturing that sense of possibility is what we now need. Prof George Williams’ proposal for a standing constitutional commission, outlinedin his book People Powerco-written with David Hume, is a good place to start. In the spirit of the 21st century this can no longer be left to constitutional lawyers and former politicians but must embrace the nascent models of democratic reform – deliberative democracy, citizen juries, community and internet-enabled consultation – as well as regular conventions and parliamentary feedback. Make it exciting, inclusive and transformative, informed by but not captive to political parties. A standing commission that reaches wide and builds its own authority. Political leaders and academics like to point to the Australian Electoral Commissionas a model for best practice democracy, and it does an admirable job, although many Australians are still remarkably ignorant about the political system. To transform Australia there is a need for more energy, more engagement and education, less room for ignorance and prejudice. An energetic constitutional commission could do this – appealing like the Uluru statement directly to the Australian people. It is unconscionable to think Australia should be constrained indefinitely by a 19th century document. A nation without meaningful recognition of the First Peoples and subservient to the Crown; a place where embracing a bill of rights and equal political opportunities for dual citizens are off the table. Anah, yeahethos ready to embrace change would make this a much more exciting, prosperous, independent and inclusive nation, a better fit for the troubled 21st century.

lifestyle,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/oct/13/anxiety-can-make-you-fear-the-worst-but-dont-let-it-ruin-your-life,2024-10-13,"Anxiety can make you fear the worst, but don’t let it ruin your life | Psychology | The Guardian",,"Has anyone ever told you to “stop worrying” or that “it will all work out in the end”? It doesn’t really help, does it? After more than 10 years of working with clients as a psychotherapist, I am so aware of the headspace that worry and anxiety consumes. I know how uncertainty can taint otherwise wonderful experiences, catch us restless in the dark while those around us sleep, and find us living much of life from a braced position. As a child, I was full of worry, having lived through one of my own worst-case scenarios: losing a sibling. No matter how many times someone told me not to worry, it never silenced the thoughts and fears in my mind. How can someone reassure me that the worst probably won’t happen when, in one way, it already has? We reassure each other that “it’s fine, nobody is judging you”, or “I’m sure that medical test will come back clear”, yet these well-meaning words don’t tend to offer much of the reassurance we crave, because we know full well that bad thingsdohappen, wedoget judged by others and there’s always a chance the test will come back positive.  Ploughing endless energy into trying to control the uncontrollable is keeping us all tired and troubled. The fact is that ignoring fears doesn’t make them less true, it makes them more powerful. After years of struggling with my own anxiety, I decided to try a different tack – and it changed my world. Instead of doing everything I could to ease and avoid life’s uncomfortable truths, I sought a deeper acceptance of them. Through using this approach, I discovered that anxiety finally began to loosen its grip. In researching my book I discovered 10 uncomfortable realities that many of us are afraid to face – ways you can thrive amid these uncertainties and embrace more of life’s joy, despite full awareness of what’s at stake. 1. Some people don’t like me.Ask yourself this. If planning a holiday, would you trust an opinion given by someone who had never set foot in the country? Of course you wouldn’t. You’d seek advice from someone who had visited, stayed in a great location, eaten around the town. Remember this next time you find yourself ruminating over someone’s judgment of you. If they don’t truly know you, does their assessment deserve to take up so much bandwidth in your mind? 2. I am going to fail.If you are someone who fears failing at things, or you find your inner critic goes haywire when something didn’t go as you’d hoped, ask yourself whether your expectations were realistic. Remember, failing at something doesn’t mean you are a failure, it just means that something didn’t work out as you’d hoped, either because your expectations were sky-high, something happened outside your control, or because you’re a human who makes mistakes sometimes. 3. Life isn’t fair.We can expend so much energy shaking our fist at life’s curveballs and feeling the injustice of situations we see happening to or around us. It’s important to seek fairness despite the fact that life isn’t inherently fair. Bad things happen to good people, people hurt one another. But feeling like a victim of life’s unfairness can keep us stuck and unmotivated. As we accept that life isn’t fair, and stop shaking our fists, we free up energy to take a small (or large) step in doing something about it. 4. I will hurt people I love.Oh, the things we’ve swallowed down and the truths we haven’t told out of fear of hurting people. The thing is that, in avoiding honest (albeit sometimes difficult) conversations, we aren’t protecting our treasured relationships as much as we like to think – we’re welcoming an elephant into the room. It is your responsibility to be authentic and to do it as kindly as you can, but you cannot control how someone chooses to respond to that honesty. A good relationship can withstand healthy boundaries and tricky conversations. 5. I can’t always be fully present.We are encouraged to be more mindful in our daily lives, but this can add pressure. Our minds are created to hop between awareness of the past, present and future. Instead of feeling guilty for not being “present enough”, here’s a piece of advice. Every now and again, pause, look around and let your eyes rest on something beautiful, intriguing or interesting. Inhale and acknowledge what is going on in and around you. Now, as you reflect on your day, which may have passed in a busy blur, these are the moments that stay with you. 6. People misunderstand me.It can feel painful when, despite trying to articulate yourself, someone doesn’t “get you”. You can feel isolated and self-questioning when you don’t have two or three people in your life who truly understand where you’re coming from. Consider who those two or three people might be and invest in those relationships, taking steps to be open and honest with those you feel safe with and cared for by. Nurturing these relationships mean that it takes the pressure off and disempowers the importance of others “getting” you. 7. I am not good enough.If you experience a feeling of “not being good enough”, it may well be because you’re not. Ask whether you don’t feel good enough because the bar of expectation you’ve set, or has been set for you, is simply too high to reach for alone. Sometimes when we question whether we’re good enough, it’s important to recognise that we may be asking ourselves “am I perfect enough?”. Amending the bar of expectation to reflect your humanly limited resources means you’ll find you’re more often than not “good enough” to reach it. 8. Bad things will happen.Anxiety can make life feel as if you’re in a waiting room for bad things to happen, meaning you miss out on the joy, adventure and rest that is there for the taking. Next time you feel a wave of anxiety roll over you, or you catch yourself ruminating over the worst-case scenarios, repeat the mantra, “I will cross that bridge if I get to it.” This doubles as a reminder that you have crossed many bridges of challenge thus far, and survived. The “if” reminds you that many of the things you fear don’t come to fruition. It invites you to draw your attention to whatishappening rather than whatmayhappen. 9. I will lose people I love.This is a big one, isn’t it? The instigator of nightmares and the theme of our worst-case scenarios. Grief and loss are the flipsides of the richness that love brings to our lives. If your fear of loss is creating a shadow over your enjoyment of the relationships that you have, seek out stories of those who have journeyed through healthy grief and found ways to build their life. Speak to friends who’ve lost loved ones and are still living and thriving. When I fear that I couldn’t withstand the heartbreak of losing one of my kids, I consider my mother who lives a full and happy life despite the unending awareness of who is missing. 10. I am going to die.In my book, I speak about a friend who told me she often feels aware that she’s standing in one massive queue to her death, and has no idea of the position in the queue, nor can she change it. At first, I found this quite horrifying but, in time, I found it rather liberating. When you hold a gentle awareness of life’s limitations in mind, it can prompt you to live more fully and in line with your values. When I come to the end of my life, I want to be glad I prioritised my relationships and didn’t sweat the small stuff, so it prompts me to live in line with that value now. What about you? It can be confronting to see these truths in black and white. But we know, deep down, that these are truths that none of us can escape, and the less mental space the fear consumes, the more space you’ll create for joy and authenticity. There is an African proverb that captures my motivation behind seeking more acceptance of these truths. It goes: “When death finds you, may it find you alive.” I don’t want to wait until a curveball trauma forces me to be grateful for the joys in my life and the limited opportunity I have to embrace them, nor do I want to wait until I’m older and (more) grey to care less what others think. I don’t want to live a half-life blighted by fear of failure or bad things happening, and I don’t want you to have that either.

We worked back to back in the biochemistry laboratory. I soon discovered to my delight that he was on top of the subject and could answer my questions. I remember thinking: “This man is smart, and useful.” Soon I would “accidentally” come across him at the cafeteria, library and bookshop. Eventually he asked me out but we only dated for a few months. There was no drama. We drifted apart. He told me later he found me too frivolous; I found him too serious. Fast forward two years and we were both studying for our honours. We began running into each other late at night in the library and we fell back into comfortable conversation. My mother noticed that he was being mentioned more often and invited him to my 21st birthday party. He looked so handsome at the door holding a big bunch of flowers, and got on so easily with my friends. As he climbed into his car to leave, he asked me out to the movies.  A week later we were early to the movie session, so we window-shopped. We talked and talked; he had such wide interests. Every time he spoke I learned something. He was kind and quietly self-confident and I sensed a gentle strength about him. He wasn’t as serious as I thought. I could make him laugh – the ultimate compliment. I was filled with joy. I didn’t want the window-shopping to end. That night he took me to see Charly, with Cliff Robertson; later, it was2001: A Space Odyssey. Maybe it was a test since science fiction was one of his passions. If so, I passed. Being with Dean was so intellectually stimulating. He opened up new worlds for me. I began to work through his science fiction library. I’d have dinner with his family and then we’d both retire to his bedroom and shut the door – to listen to classical music. The family said later they wondered what we were doing. Beethoven! We shared an interest in astronomy and combined our meagre savings to buy a telescope. He understood the scientific and technical aspects; I knew my way around the sky and could show himSaturn’s rings. His main hobby was shell collecting, and his idea of the perfect date was us crawling on our stomachs along the beach, looking for tiny shells. It became my favourite activity. We became inseparable. Dean was reserved, independent and hid his emotions. I didn’t expect declarations of undying love. About three months into our relationship, he went away to a week-long science conference – I told him I’d miss him. His reply: “I’m going to have a good time.” I met the bus when he returned, waiting excitedly at the stop late at night. As he came down the bus steps, I realised he looked a little pale and seedy. We hugged. Then as we turned to leave he said, “I missed you”, not looking at me, not in a romantic way but almost defiant. How dare I get under his skin! How dare I force him to express an emotion! I took a moment to process what he’d said and then the words hit me like a thunderbolt. That’s when I knew he loved me. And he’d broken through a hangover to express it. He was never going to get rid of me after that. We went back to our respective homes and I think he must have slept well but I was possessed by a happy restlessness. We married in 1971 (I asked him) and have been together for 53 years. What I didn’t perhaps appreciate at first was Dean’s kindness, patience, respect for others and loyalty. His calmness balanced my more outgoing personality. He did half the housework and eventually took over the cooking. He was a hands-on parent to our daughter from the start, changing nappies and comforting a restless baby all night. This was not so common for men in the 1970s! He nursed me through two bouts of breast cancer. Older people called on him to help with odd jobs and computer wrangling. Of course we sometimes clashed. I was neat and he was messy. He was cautious, I was more impulsive. We were both stubborn but we learned to say “sorry” and mean it. Most of all, we had such fun. Love is knowing there’s always someone who’s on your side. It’s been a life of adventure, travel, learning and sharing. We loved the outdoors. We studied and wrote about nature, and spread the conservation message. We’ve experienced ancient fossil sites, active volcanoes and the Arctic tundra; camped alone in a vast red desert, hiked the Rocky Mountains, and journeyed to places in Kyoto mentioned in ancient Japanese literature. After retiring from our science careers, I worked on the moth collection in Museums Victoria. Dean was down the corridor working on shells. I’m now the only one who carries these memories. Dean has severe dementia and is in a home. When I visit he recognises me occasionally. Then he smiles and takes my hand. We walk in the garden of the home and, as always, our love for the outdoors brings us together. Tell us the moment you knew Do you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

We had a happy relationship – three sons and a good sex life. After he died a few years ago it was like I’d lost all desire for sex. I had no interest, but felt sad that a part of myself that I’d enjoyed was gone. In February this year I decided I was too young for that to be my final relationship, so I downloaded a dating app. I wasn’t expecting much, but then I saw Henry’s profile. He’d lost his wife and had three sons, like me. We met at a wine bar and had a strong connection. He invited me to his place. I said mine was closer. I had never slept with anyone on a first date – not even my husband. I was nervous. Would it be awkward? Would he need Viagra? Would I have issues with lubrication? I had saggy parts, and I felt overweight and vulnerable. But it was lovely. We kissed on the sofa, and then went to the bedroom. We’ve been seeing each other for six months now, usually every weekend and once during the week. I enjoy the ritual of getting ready when he comes over on a Friday night. I take a long shower, put on lotion – all those things that when you’re married for a long time, you don’t tend to do. We have sex several times a night, and I always have a lot of orgasms, which is new for me. I’m much more open with him than I was even with my husband. I think I was more reserved in the past. Early on, we talked a little bit about our sex lives with our spouses. Fairly quickly, I decided I didn’t want to do that: when he talked about his late wife I couldn’t help but make comparisons; I also didn’t want to have grief come into this wonderful new relationship. Grief has changed me. I’m much more in the moment than I ever was. I was always the good person: taking care of my kids and my parents, and working hard. Now I think, what the hell: let’s have sex on the first night, let’s have sex all Sunday morning. Why not? I’ve learned that life is fleeting.

But I think having had a long, successful relationship gave me confidence I remember, after my first night with Grace, thinking to myself: wow, welcome back to the land of the living. It had been a hard few years. My wife died in 2022 – we’d been together for 35 years. She knew for the last nine months that she didn’t have long left. After about a year alone I started to think, “Maybe I’m ready to meet someone else”. I made a dating profile in February. Grace messaged me within a few days. Grace told me some of her friends thought she was crazy, taking me home on the first date, but it felt reasonable. I did think: should I get some Viagra? But it turned out to not be a problem. We started slowly and after half an hour it was really good. It’s been six months now. We have agreed that we don’t want to live together. I think living apart makes things exciting. Every time I’m going to see her, I get a feeling of anticipation and nervousness. It feels that, at the age of sixtysomething, we’ve had the opportunity to start again, with the lust of our teenage years, but all the wisdom we’ve acquired since. We have sex a lot: three or four times a day. We’ll start off on the sofa and then head for the bedroom. I’ve been amazed at how natural it has all been. Before meeting my late wife, my dating life was unsatisfying. But I think having had a long, very successful relationship gave me confidence that I hadn’t had before. It makes me really happy having Grace around. I think about her a lot when I’m not with her. And the sex, apart from being really enjoyable, reassures me that I’m not dead yet. When you reach our age, you’ve got a choice: you either start slowing down and getting old or you have to head off in a different direction. This feels like that: an entirely new chapter of my life – maybe even a new book. Would you and your partner like to share the story, anonymously, of your sex life?",Kate Lloyd
lifestyle,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/13/the-thing-about-parenting-is-that-it-is-basically-financially-ruinous,2024-10-13,"The thing about parenting is that it is, basically, financially ruinous | Family | The Guardian",,"One of the things about writing a parenting column is that expectant parents sometimes ask me for advice, as strange as that may seem to those who actually know me (or read this column). My advice is mostly the usual stuff: support the head, pat their bums; never refuse an offer of help or a chance to sleep; and don’t worry about nappy changes because any phobia of foul smells and runny fluids will quickly be replaced with a fear of everything on earth that can damage the fragile little person you’re in charge of. Increasingly, however, I have to talk about money, too, because the single most abiding pressure of parenting – for those lucky enough to have healthy, happy children at least – is the fact that it is, basically, financially ruinous.  I have been writing this column for six and a half years and I have never once mentioned how financially perilous it has been, mainly because I’m aware that other people have it much worse. I also find it boring and embarrassing to write about my money worries full stop, and have an inkling that readers might feel the same reading about it. But ignoring money entirely becomes, itself, irresponsible. There have been many months – years in fact – where it has been the single biggest parenting issue in my life, and not being clear about this is negligent. Baby formula costs £17 and, here in the sixth richest country on the planet, shops routinely keep it security-tagged. The UK’s statutory maternity pay is among the lowest in Europe and yet Conservative leadership hopeful Kemi Badenoch thinks it’s so high that it works against the ‘personal responsibility’ of mothers – the kind she exercised when she had the good sense to avoid such worries by marrying an investment banker. Last month, we cheered when my daughter became eligible for 15 hours’ free childcare, and this week her nursery’s fees increased by almost the exact amount of money we would have saved. This, of course, is the problem with creating a system wherein the economic benefit of working must be offset by the economic cost of having children. On the macro level, the UK’s powers-that-be claim to want its citizens to go forth and multiply. Think the ‘breed for Britain’ sloganeering, which accompanied the recent Tory party conference, rhetoric that had more than a slight ring of ‘summon the brood mares’ about it, even if they weren’t simultaneously clamouring for economic conditions that would make such fecundity unfeasible. Our childcare costs, including nursery fees and after-school clubs, are roughly equal to our rent. We’d like to buy a home one day, but that feels increasingly like science fiction given that we usually end up with a little too much month by the money’s end – a situation we share with almost every other parent we know. Were I to actually say all these things, any prospective parent will have wished they never asked me for advice in the first place. So, I assure them it’ll all be fine. Support the head. Sleep when you can. And marry an investment banker at the earliest opportunity. Follow Séamas on X@shockproofbeats",Séamas O’Reilly
lifestyle,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/oct/13/austria-zell-am-see-austrian-alps-outdoor-fun-hearty-food-stunning-views,2024-10-13,"Clean air, crystal waters and carefree adventure in the Austrian Alps | Travel | The Guardian",,"We could feel the carefree spirit in the crisp air the moment we stepped off the train at Zell am See. It’s in the town’s DNA. Pleasure seekers have been coming to this lake and mountain resort in search of clean air, crystal waters and Alpine adventures ever since the railway connected what was then a mere village to Salzburg and beyond in 1875. We’d come to walk, bike a little, swim a bit and reward ourselves with Austrian cuisine – at a restorative, schedule-free pace.  We passed bakeries, hiking shops and the Romanesque church in the old town on the way to our hotel, before joining the 10km tree-lined promenade that rings the lake. Waffle and ice-cream stands, terrace cafés, strollers and couples holding hands, the glistening lake… It felt like we had gone back in time. Our hotel, the Tirolerhof, also had a timeless feel to it. A vernacular Alpine chalet, the reception lounge has winged armchairs, an open fire for snowy winter nights and a trad bar with stools and a small painted sign saying “Save Water. Drink Champagne”. Upstairs, the flower-filled balcony of our smart, wood-panelled bedroom looked straight on to the Schmittenhöhe mountains. The sun was still high and so we headed straight out toSeespitz lido, one of a handful of public lidos that pepper the lake. The lido was so perfect, it felt surreal: manicured lawns, teenagers playing frisbee, a café selling apple cake and ice-creams, super-clean changing rooms, a heated, metal-lined swimming pool and steps leading into the cool, clear – and drinkable – lake. The mountains all around us, paddle-boarders ambling past, theMS Schmittenhöhe I Schiffartheading to various drop-off points on the lake, including Thumersbach lido across the water – it’s a dream ticket. The lake’s charms are not lost on tourists from the Gulf States who have been coming to the resort to escape the sun ever since someone from the local tourist board realised that Zell am See’s lake surrounded by snow-capped mountains matched the description of Paradise in the Qur’an – and duly promoted the destination. No holiday is complete without a round of mini golf, at least in my family, but the ersatz Brutalism and brushed steel of the “course” at Zell am See’s Strandbad lido made me feel as though I was in an art installation. I was quite put off my swing, calling for fortification at the lakeside terrace barPinzga Bräu, part of the deliciously ostentatiousGrand Hotel. But if restraint is your aesthetic, have a sundowner at the lakesideSeevilla Freiberghotel instead. I fared better on an e-bike, hired fromBründl Sports, a short bus ride away at the AreitXpress cable car station. We doubled back to the north shore of the lake, turning off at the chapel at Thumersbach for theMitterberg tour. I love e-bikes: little effort and such rewards. We whizzed up a hairpin section ofSchmittenhöhe, our (barely deserved) reward a hearty lunch of Pinzgauer Kasnocken, or Austrian cheese and onion dumplings, strudel and cold beers on the stunning terrace overlooking Lake Zell atBerggasthof Mitterberg. The inn sits at 1,200m between the Kitzsteinhorn and Schmittenhöhe. We devoured the view. On the way back, we stopped for another dip at the Thumersbach lido – Lake Zell really is irresistible. As I swam, I thought of young Wordsworth having his moment of numinous awe as he rowed towards a looming mountain in the Lake District, and of how much more fun it was to be a teenager, or any age, really, if you were in striking distance of a sunny, blue-skied Alpine lake. That evening we had an exceptional dinner on the garden terrace of the Tirolerhof. The chef prepared a three-course dinner especially for the vegan among us, which turned out to be much envied by us pescatarians. It was a very strong contender for best-meal award during our visit to Zell am See, which celebrates its evolving culinary heritage during its annualFestival of Alpine Cuisine. From early morning, we could hear cow bells jingling through our open shutters – surely the most charming of wake-up calls. After breakfast we nipped on a local bus to walk the 320m path that winds up through theSigmund Thun Klammgorge – a short but thrilling experience. Powering down from glaciers and mountains above the Kaprun Valley, the Kapruner Ache river has carved a gorge 30m deep; the wooden path takes you right up through it, past a series of small waterfalls, until you step away to the peace and openness of the Klammsee Reservoir, which itself makes for a lovely stroll. Ever on the look out for culinary pitstops, I spotted a sign off the path, pointing up toSchneckenreith, a family-friendly hiking trail and eponymous farm which, I only later discovered, serves homemade cakes and local dishes. It took another local bus to the Maiskogel cable car station, and three cable cars, to make the ascent to the highest point of the Kitzsteinhorn glacier, the final one being the James Bond style 3k-Connection – so-named because the summit, or Top of Salzburg, is 3,039m above sea level. From the viewing platform, the Gipfelwelt 3000, you can see the peaks of Hohe Tauern National Park – apparently. Sadly, we had to imagine them: the mist had closed in and we couldn’t see a thing. Our eyes feasted that evening, though, as we were taken on a regional culinary tour over five courses atKraftwerk(kraftwerk-restaurant.at), a local restaurant and wine bar. From a cellar of over 1,200 bottles, dishes are paired with wines from Japan, Lebanon and Uruguay, as well as from Austria. We feasted, but were left wanting more – more of this fine restaurant’s mouth-watering dishes, but more, too, of everything Zell am See has to offer.

lifestyle,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/12/how-to-hang-your-pictures-art,,‘Try them in different places’ - how and where to hang your pictures | Home improvements | The Guardian,,"Wherever you get your pictures, in your mind’s eye you want them to be as expertly hung as the Royal Academy of Arts’Summer Exhibition. But poorly spaced frames and wonky canvases can spoil the final effect. In the first instance, think about where a piece of art will look its best and the hanging system – picture rail or hooks – that suits your home.  “Pictures look different depending on where you hang them,” says HenryMiller, an east London-based art dealer and gallery owner. “Try them in different places.” He says direct sunlight should be avoided if possible: “Some mediums can take more light than others. Oil paintings are more resilient, but watercolours, drawings and photographs are not.” You could consider using UV glass, he says, as this will “protect the works for years to come” – you can buy sheets to fit your frames on websites including Etsy. The next step is tackling the hanging system. “If you live in a period home, you may have a picture rail already and all you will need is the hooks and wires,” says Miller. “It will save you making endless holes in the walls. It also frees you up to try different pictures without messing up the wall.” Think about the look you are trying to create. Some collectors break up walls into small feature areas and treat each one separately. On Instagram trends include creating asalon wall, where a number of pictures of varying mediums and sizes are hung next to one another, or curating a picture ledge – a narrow shelf on which you can prop your pictures. Generally speaking, the size of the gap between pictures is less important than keeping it consistent. Many interiors sites suggest a 5cm gap works well but if the frames are larger, then up to 15cm provides some breathing space. Lay the art on the floor or even use a piece of paper to come up with a scale that fits your room. A strict grid look more formal, whereas a group hung within a square or rectangle appears more relaxed. One of the most common mistakes to make is hanging pictures too high or low, with most professionals taking the view that art should be hung at eye level. This usually means positioning the midpoint of the picture 145cm-152cm from the floor or 20cm above a piece of furniture. Another approach is to visually your wall and divide into four horizontally – ideally your work should be in the third section when counting up from the floor. Before you reach for the hammer gather the other tools you are going to need. These include a tape measure (some experts suggest “trusting your eye” but this could end in tears), pencil, hammer, a range of hooks and nails. Also try to enlist a friend or family member to help. If your picture isn’t too heavy you can use regular picture-hanging hooks but if it is on the larger side, opt for a big hook with multiple nails to secure it. If it is really heavy, you may need to use a drill, raw plug and screw to fix a sturdier hook in the wall. Once you have used your measuring tape, lightly mark the wall where the centre of the picture should be and ask your assistant to hold the picture in place so you can step back to double check. When you are happy, place another mark on the wall at the top edge of the frame. Next, measure the distance between the top of the frame down to the wire or D-ring (if it’s a wire hold it taut). Returning to the wall, measure down from the point that marks the top of the frame to find the exact spot where the hook should go. What could possibly go wrong?",Zoe Wood
lifestyle,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/12/picture-buy-art-prices-galleries-fairs,,Picture perfect: how to buy art at prices you can afford | Consumer affairs | The Guardian,,"That a Banksy painting is worth morepartly shreddedthan when it was whole can make the art world seem like another planet for “in the know” people with big bank balances. But don’t be put off, it has never been easier to start your own collection. Next week, 20,000 visitors will descend onthe Affordable Art Fair(AAF) in London’s Battersea Park and over the four days will browse and buy thousands of contemporary paintings, sculptures, photographs and prints. It’s one of a number of similar events around the UK; the autumn months are a busy time in the art calendar.  At the fair, seasoned pros rub shoulders with first-time and “tomorrow’s” buyers, says Will Ramsay, founder of the event. Ramsay started the fair to “make it easier for people to buy art”. As the event celebrates its 25th year, he declares: “We have done that.” The average spend at the fair is about £800, with prices starting at about £50 for an edition with a ceiling at £7,500. (An edition is a reproduction of an original image. It is up to the artist how many pieces are in the series; they are usually numbered and sometimes signed, which can add to their value and collectability.) An art work such as an etching which is one of 25, will cost less than a unique painting. “For an edition, we’re probably talking £50 to £500,” says Ramsay. “For a unique piece, it might be £200 to £7,500.” Just like buying anything for your home, you need to do your homework. With art, it’s not just about setting a budget, you need to wrestle with “how do I know what is good?” And “am I paying the right price?” Some people find choosing pictures a daunting prospect but buying art should be pleasurable, saysHenry Miller, an east London-based art dealer and gallery owner. “People worry about buying the wrong thing or paying too much,” or whether it will “match the sofa”, but Miller says “try to put all of that out of your mind.” He adds: “If you can afford it and you love it, that should be enough.” If you are still at the stage of figuring out which style or medium you like best, experts suggest joining a non-profit art institution as a way to gain exposure to lots of work. In London, for example, a Royal Academy membership starts at £138 a year or £67 for 16- to 35-year-olds. Most places have several pricing tiers and, generally speaking, the more you pay the greater the access to artists, curators and gallerists. Another simple option is to usesocial mediato follow artists, contemporary commercial galleries and art fairs for alerts on upcoming events in the arts calendar and to join mailing lists. “Instagram is becoming an increasingly important forum for artists, galleries and collectors, with a growing number of buyers purchasing works found through the platform,” says Katherine Oliver, consultant and ex-curator at the Royal Academy. Browsing online galleries –Artsy is the biggest– lets you compare artists, styles and prices. Also keep an eye on graduates from the major art schools such as the Royal College ofArt, Slade School of Fine Art, and Central Saint Martins. “Go to graduate shows, meet artists and talk to them about their work,” says Oliver. “In two or three years they could be represented by a commercial gallery and their pieces may rocket in value.” Research art online, then look at what is showing locally, or get involved with the local art scene, says Lizzie Glendinning, co-founder and curator ofWoolwich Contemporary Print Fairwhich bills itself as “disrupting the elitist nature of art fairs, and pushing the boundaries of print”. Glendinning adds that it really depends on why you’re buying and what you are interested in: “I like dark and moody, so I need to see that in real life.” Fairs can provide inspiration, Glendinning says. Woolwich, which is a mix of specialist galleries and artists selected by industry experts, is expected to attract 15,000 visitors from 21-24 November. “No one is expecting anyone to drop £30,000,” she says, although some people do – one of the galleries made a £60,000 sale last year. “This year we’ve got some works for under £100 but then we also have celebrated names for £25,000. We’ve got entry points for all types of collectors.” At the moment alack of megasalesmeans that the top end of London’s art world is feeling a chill. People are still willing to spend five- and six-figure sums at the bigger fairs, but one analyst said that when the price topped £1m “they were just a little bit more cautious”. “At the high and middle end in a less booming economy the art market suffers,” says Ramsay. “However, at the Affordable Art Fair level, over the 25 years we’ve seen fairly little difference in the overall art sold. That is because we gain some people who might have bought more expensive work and sadly lose some off the bottom, for whom it is too tight.” If there’s a piece that you’ve fallen in love with but it’s too expensive, then don’t be afraid to ask if you can pay in instalments. If it’s a “no” then ask if the artist has smaller works or whether it is possible to commission a piece from them that better fits your budget. Another option is to look out for editions produced by major artists to help raise funds for non-profit making organisations such as the Royal Academy. Allied Editionsis a “unique artist editions collective” of seven London venues – including the Camden Arts Centre and the Whitechapel Gallery – with prices starting at £100. It has a stand at this weekend’s high-end art fair Frieze London selling limited editions from a roster of famous names includingMonster Chetwynd,Judy Chicago,Lubaina Himid,Chantal Joffe,Barbara Kruger,Helen MartenandYoko Ono. It is also possible to spread the cost thanks to theOwn Artinitiative which offers interest-free loans of up to £25,000 to make it “easier and more affordable for people to buy and enjoy original art and craft, regardless of their income and socioeconomic background”. With a network of nearly 300 galleries across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland,Own Arthas facilitated £75m worth of sales of contemporary art and craft to more than 83,000 people over the past 20 years. “I’m up to my eyes in Own Art payments,” jokes Glendinning, who says the scheme has been a gamechanger. “When we introduced it for the [Woolwich Contemporary Print Fair] we got at least a third more sales. Instead of paying £400 for a print upfront, you can pay £40 a month; and that’s less than a night out.” While it is human nature to hope you’ve picked up something by the next Banksy, Ramsay stresses that it is very important that people “love what they’re buying”. “They’ve got to want to live with it,” he says. “If they discover in 20 years’ time the art has gone up in value then they can feel smug about their excellent taste. Some go up. Many don’t. Investment shouldn’t be the primary aim.” London-based art dealer Miller says would-be buyers should opt for quality over quantity. Buy “one or two works a year for as much as you can afford”, he says. “If you do this, in a few years you’ll have an outstanding collection.” Occasionally you’ll make mistakes, he adds, but don’t worry. “Learn from it. You can always sell the mistake and buy something else.”",Zoe Wood

But a new documentary about the couple exposes the eerie similarities between the 70s and now, the Oscar-winning director behind the film has said.  One to One, byKevin Macdonald, portrays Lennon and Ono’s life over an 18-month period after their move to New York in 1971, when they quickly became figureheads for the counterculture and anti-Vietnam war movements. Showing at theLondon film festival, it centres around the 1972 One to One benefit concert at Madison Square Garden – Lennon’s last full-length concert and his only one after the Beatles – performed in aid of children with special needs. “What I hadn’t realised until I started making this was that the period seems like an incredible echo of today, it’s like a mirror image,” Macdonald said. His film incorporates newly restored 16mm film footage of the concert, archival news clips – of the Attica prison riot, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam war and the shooting of the Alabama governor George Wallace – as well as previously unheard tapes of Lennon and Ono’s private phone calls, recorded by them when they became concerned the FBI was tapping their communications. Combined, it acted as a corrective to the idea that there is something uniquely divisive about contemporary politics, Macdonald said. “There was a lot of stuff about the early environmental movement and ads on TV to stop oil. I thought we were only just having these conversations. “George Wallace is such a clear Trump precedent, especially with the recent assassination attempts. Vietnam was dividing society in the same way Gaza is today. Shirley Chisholm was the first Black woman running for president. I thought, ‘God, there’s nothing new in American politics,’ it’s like it’s stuck in some cycle.” Macdonald, who has directed films including One Day in September, Touching the Void, Whitney, The Last King of Scotland, and The Mauritanian, said the realisation was “strangely reassuring”. “We all think that today’s politics is uniquely terrible, but this shows something different will come. That maybe Trump is not the end of the world.” He said throughout he wanted to explore the question: “What do you do once you’ve been in the biggest band in the world, and you’re only 30?” Footage and recordings were provided by Lennon’s family, while Macdonald and his wife Tatiana Macdonald, a set decorator, remade Lennon and Ono’s West Village apartment including their posters, records and the TV at the foot of their bed. “I heard this interview with John, where he talks about how when he first arrived in America, all he did was watch TV,” the director said. “I thought, ‘That’s a way into this.’ Let’s make the film about them watching TV and learning about America.” The phone recordings also provide a rare insight into the pair’s thinking at the time. In one, Ono describes what it was like to be blamed for breaking up the Beatles and the racial abuse she was subject to in Britain, including being called “ugly” by the press. In another, Lennon describes his idea for a US tour that would raise bail money for American prisoners who could not afford the fees, as well as efforts to get Bob Dylan onboard (and persuade the Dylan aggravator AJ Weberman to leave the musician alone). Macdonald said he was particularly moved by the couple’s activism some years before they became reclusive, and even split up for a while (with John temporarily moving to LA). There’s a moment in the concert, during the song Come Together, when Lennon shouts: “Stop the war.” During another song he shouts “Vote”, with the 1972 US election looming.Nixon wonagainst the leftwing Democrat George McGovern. “They campaigned to defeat Nixon. But not only did Nixon win, he received the majority of the votes of young Americans under the age of 25,” Macdonald said. “I think it’s what led to John’s big period of alcoholism and the split. They tried to change things, and it didn’t work. And that’s heartbreaking, obviously.” But he added that there was something that stood out about Lennon and Ono’s activism compared with the modern celebrity’s: it was done at a grassroots level rather than on Instagram and X. “People from that time told me their door was just kind of open,” he said. “You would just go in and have tea with them on their bed.” Lennon wasfatally shot in 1980. Has Macdonald thought about what the musician would be like if he were alive today? “Quite a lot, actually. I think he would stay true to his very simple message of peace. He would have remained on the side of the underdog. But I think he would have also got himself into trouble, because he was always so honest.” For the director, that is one of the reasons it would “have been so great” having him around today. “Too many celebrities feel the pressure of social media to censor themselves, to say the right thing, to not contradict themselves,” he said. “But you see in the film that somebody who is actually confident knows that they’re not going to always think the same thing. They learn from their mistakes.”",Nadia Khomami

Live on an abattoir’ | Australian food and drink | The Guardian,,"You’re a judge on this year’s Dessert Masters. What are you secretly the master of? I am the master of dodging a question. I feel like the last couple of years have been a good time to flex my media training. You don’t always want to, as human beings, share everything of who you are. I feel like I can say what I want to say, but keep a little bit for myself. And I think that’s something we should all be good at doing: holding a little bit back for ourselves and our loved ones.  What is the most memorable dessert you have ever eaten? An experimental dessert I had in Slovenia a couple of years ago by Ana Roš at Hiša Franko in the Soča Valley. She was working on a dessert that involved beef fat ice-cream. Being in rural Slovenia, it was all about finding interesting ways to use everything she has available to her. And that wasn’t a finished dish. There was a little bit of graininess still involved in the churning of the beef fat into ice-cream, but it was delicious nonetheless. There’s aChef’s Tableabout her from a couple of years ago. If you had a sandwich named after you, what would be in it? If I think about the sandwich I really want to eat right now, it’s marinated artichoke, mortadella, sopressa, fontina; I’m thinking pickled Italian vegetable deli roll. One of the best sandwiches I’ve ever had in my entire life is amuffuletta. I had it from Central Grocery, which is the originator of it in New Orleans. When I went to order the sandwich I said: “One sandwich.” And the guy just looked at me like I was insane. When he gave me the sandwich, I realised why – it’s the entire loaf, so it feeds about six people. I was just travelling with one other person, and over the period of the next couple of days, every time we would come home a little bit sauced we just ate a bit more sandwich. A good deli sandwich is a thing of beauty. What do you do when you can’t get to sleep? I do battle with insomnia from time to time. I’m one of those – I listen to creepy stories from Reddit being read in a monotone voice. I’ve been listening toPatric Gagne’s book Sociopath: A Memoir, and it is voiced by the author. She ends up getting a doctorate in psychology,specialising in sociopathy, and she’s the most self-aware sociopath I’ve ever heard of. She’s explaining,from the driver’s seat,what it’s like to be her,and what she can feel and what she can’t. It’s very interesting but also helps me go to sleep because the sociopath is out there and in my ears, but not in my house. What’s the oldest thing you own, and why do you still have it? I think with Chinese custom we tend to get rid of stuff, because new means auspicious. So I don’t tend to hold on to a lot; I’m pretty good when I move house. But if I really think about it, it’s probably a bracelet I inherited from my grandmother on my father’s side, which is two dragon heads interlocked. What’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity? It’s with Luke McGregor, who has become a friend of mine now! A couple of Logies ago, I was wearing a dress with gloves that extended into sleeves, so there was no gap to take your hand out. Gorgeous, gorgeous gown. He shook my hand, and he’s like: “How are you going to go to the loo in that dress?” And I didn’t really think about that when I tried it on. Luke is so lovingly awkward, and so am I, which is why we ended up bonding. We workshopped how I was going to go to the loo in this dress, and the answer was not to drink much water or anything at all so I didn’t have to go. In the end, I basically had to take the entire thing off to go and wash my hands, semi-naked, then get dressed again. What book or film do you always return to? I really love watchingRatatouille. It’s just wholesome and lovely and beautiful. And on the other side of the coin, the entire Fast and Furious franchise. Polar opposites, but they’re both really comforting. I just rewatched Tokyo Drift. Don’t ask me how many times I’ve seen it. It’s one of the worst and best movies of all time. I will routinely work my way through the entire Fast and Furious franchise because, you know, there’s nothing like family. What’s the weirdest thing you’ve done for love? Live on an abattoir in Tasmania for about a year. My boyfriend at the time owned and ran the abattoir and came from an engineering background; he ended up teaching himself how to be a slaughterman and a butcher. I’m still a very meaty kind of gal. I do feel like that entire experience made me so much more appreciative of the fullness of life, our access to meat. If you ever have the opportunity to see how it goes from animal to your dinner plate, you should do it. Because if you can’t face how your food gets to you, then maybe you shouldn’t eat it. I definitely don’t eat as much meat as I used to, because I want to make more conscious choices. I think if something has given its life for your nourishment, wasting it is highly disrespectful. Obviously, you need to be rational as well and flexible with how you live. But that’s the way I look at meat. What song do you want played at your funeral? Probably getting a little bit emo, but the Nine Inch Nails cover of Hurt gets me every single time. I’m not too ashamed to admit I want people to cry at my funeral. Otherwise, These Boots Were Made for Walkin’ by Nancy Sinatra. And if I could submit a third (this is, like, the pinball that goes on inside my brain on a daily basis):Killing in the Name. Who do you want to play you in the biopic about your life? Well, that’s a question about representation, isn’t it? Like, years ago, it’d be whoever the reigning Hollywood superstar at the time was – but who looks like us? I feel very fortunate in some small way on the small screen to be a part of the visibility of east Asian women in popular culture and in the media. Who would I have to play me? Michelle Yeoh is a badass. Did you see her at the Bottega Veneta show recently? My god. Her body of work from being an accomplished martial artist to an actor to comedy, drama … just the depth and range of her ability, the fact that she’s into combat sports as well, just gives zero fucks. The more she progresses in life, the more elegant and graceful and powerful she becomes. Just as a as a human being for reference in life, I could do worse than to emulate her in any capacity. I’m really glad that there are more actors to pick from these days for us as people of colour. Long may it continue.",Michael Sun
culture,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/13/the-artists-sketchbook-v-and-a-john-constable-leonardo-da-vinci,2024-10-13,‘Immensely private’: inside great sketchbooks from history | Art and design books | The Guardian,,"What was John Constable up to at 8.30am on 26 September 1814? If his sketchbook can be trusted, the great landscape painter was in Dedham Vale on the Essex-Suffolk border sketching the valley below, using quick pencil strokes to capture shadows in the foreground, trees in the middle distance and a faraway steeple breaching the cloud-dappled sky. Alongside the sketch, which he later used as the basis for his paintingStour Valley and Dedham Church, he noted the date and exact time he committed it to paper. It’s this sense of immediacy, of peering over an artist’s shoulder as inspiration strikes, that makes flicking through sketchbooks so exciting, though the ideas are not always so fully formed. In his sketchbook from the 1880s, working on his series The Legend of the Briar Rose, Edward Burne-Jones tries out several arrangements of a knight and sleeping guards before arriving at a satisfactory composition.  And that’s just the preparatory drawings. Sketchbooks are full of diverse and unusual details, not all of them artistic, as a new book from the collection of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum makes clear. Featuring work from the 15th century to the present by luminaries such as Constable, Leonardo da Vinci and Beatrix Potter, as well as lesser-known painters and talented amateurs,The Artist’s Sketchbookoffers a fascinating insight into the recesses of the artistic mind. Some pages are devoted to learning, practice and experimentation. Others are taken up with architectural drawings, engineering designs and travel reportage. There’s plenty of marginalia, too, providing extra detail on sketches or noting something else entirely – in George Cruikshank’s 1851 sketchbook, amid the drawings, he keeps track of his accounts. “It’s the process that we’re interested in, how art is made,” says Jenny Gaschke, senior curator of paintings and drawings at the V&A, who edited the book. She and her contributors drew from nearly 350 sketchbooks in the museum’s collection, narrowing down to 76 artists. “Leonardo da Vinci sticks out a bit at the beginning, almost too much,” she says, “but to us the unknown names were of the same level of interest.” Leonardo was an early adopter of sketchbooks, which began to circulate as stationery evolved out of manuscript culture from the 13th century onwards, but according to Gaschke it was only in the 19th century, “with the increasingly industrialised production of paper but also of drawing materials”, that they became widely available. The book form is significant in its unifying effect. “It’s about having these sketches together between the covers so you can go back and forward,” says Gaschke. “Sketchbooks have been compared to families: the covers are the parents and the pages inside are the siblings, and they do all interrelate.” The fact that sketchbooks can be closed and, in some cases, secured with a clasp makes them “immensely private”, she adds, “and that causes an interesting dilemma when publishing them, because the artist didn’t intend them to be displayed. As with a writer’s journals, should we read them? But, of course, we do.” If privacy poses a dilemma here, so does visibility: the V&A’s sketchbook collection privileges white, male British and European artists, and accordingly the book features few women and even fewer artists of colour. Gaschke acknowledges the limitations. “I think it’s a very good exercise to highlight those areas of shortcoming and to say: ‘This helps us inform our collecting policy,’” she says. But the book does show how important sketchbooks were as creative outlets to women in centuries past. In an entry from 1766, we see a Mrs Hughes learning to draw from her teacher Mr Ryland, who adds drawings for her to copy – after a shaky start, she learns to replicate her master so well that they’re almost indistinguishable. One leatherbound book from 1818, meanwhile, is the only known artistic attribution to Sophia Jenkins, who filled it with brilliantly colourful paintings of butterflies and moths. Such obscurity is part of the book’s appeal – these images can’t easily be found in galleries or even online, though you can make an appointment to view sketchbooks in theV&A’s study rooms. Sharing “these more fragile, shy-of-the-light collections with our audiences” was one of Gaschke’s main reasons for creating the book. Another was to “whet the appetite: we want to encourage everyone to pick up a sketchbook and give it a try”. Even in the age of phone cameras and digital sketching software, the old-fashioned sketchbook is, she insists, very much still alive: “It’s a brilliant way of capturing in intense but fleeting moments what’s around you.”",Killian Fox
culture,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/oct/13/nick-yarris-adrien-brody-the-fear-of-13-donmar-death-row,2024-10-13,‘I could not get through the script without crying’: Adrien Brody talks to the death row survivor who he’s playing on the London stage | Theatre | The Guardian,,"The rehearsal space for theDonmar Warehousetheatre is a scruffy, gymnasium-scale, subterranean cavern in Covent Garden. Strewn around, on Monday morning last week, are some telltale signs of stressful, long days: scrunched-up packs of bourbon biscuits and custard creams, and scattered pages of heavily inked script; also, intriguingly, four (empty) boxes of heavy-duty handcuffs. Dominating the room is a makeshift stage that looks like a boxing ring without ropes and measures 3.5 metres by 3.2 metres, almost the exact dimensions of a cell on death row. Nick Yarris, a power-bald man of 63 with high cheekbones and a scar on his chin, stands in one corner and starts pacing diagonally. “One… two… three… ” he says, counting his steps, his work boots making a resonant clunk as he walks. “Jay Smith used to be in the cell above me. And he was a very famous case too, the Susan Reinert murder and all this shit. But he would pace all day and he walked seven steps one way… ”  Yarris has reached the other corner now and spins around. “But he only walked fucking six steps back!” he exclaims. “Seven there and six back. And I’d be listening in my cell and it used to drive me mad, right? I said, ‘Hey man, I got to try this out.’ So I’m in my cell… ” Adrien Brody, the 51-year-old Oscar-winning star ofThe Pianist, sits cross-legged in the corner, looking on. “One leg is shorter than the other probably,” he suggests. “Or he was going around his bed,” counters Yarris. “But no, I tried that one. Maybe he was doing it deliberately: ‘Oh, he’s doing it deliberately… ’” Brody springs to his feet; he has a lithe, athlete’s build and a flop of dark hair. He wants to try it out himself. “Here we go,” he says, “five.” Yarris shakes his head, still befuddled by a 40-year-old memory. “See the insanity of death row?” He had a lot of time to mull over such incongruities. In 1981, when he was 20, Yarris was picked up by the police in Pennsylvania in a stolen car while high on drugs. He became involved in a scuffle with the policeman, the officer’s gun went off into the air and Yarris landed in jail, facing a lengthy prison sentence. While locked up, he read about the recent case of Linda Mae Craig, who had been raped and murdered about 20 miles from where he lived. Yarris decided – his head addled by methamphetamine use, he acknowledges – to try to reduce the punishment for his misdemeanour by saying he knew who had killed Craig: a local hoodlum who Yarris heard had recently died. The problem was that the man he pinned it on wasn’t dead and was now a law-abiding citizen with an alibi. Yarris became the prime suspect in the Craig case. In July 1982, Yarris was found guilty of murdering Craigand sentenced to death. He would spend 22 years on death row, mostly in Pennsylvania but also, after he escaped and went on the run for a month, in Florida (where he shared a facility with serial killerTed Bundy). It was two decades in which Yarris was stabbed, regularly beaten and watched men die in front of his eyes. It got so bad that, even though he was assured of his own innocence, he wrote to the state governor pleading for his right to execution. Ultimately, though, new DNA testing was developed and Yarris became the first death row prisoner to use it. In January 2004, he walked free. Yarris’s story has been told in a memoir, an excellent 2015 documentary calledThe Fear of 13and nowa playof the same name, written by Lindsey Ferrentino and starring Brody as Yarris, which has just opened at the Donmar. (The title comes from a self-taught obsession with language and words that Yarris picked up in prison: “triskaidekaphobia” being one of his favourites.) Part of the reason that his tale holds up to retelling is that it is a classic one: it’s crime and punishment; a catastrophic injustice that is righted just in the nick of time; a damning indictment of the criminal justice system. But the main draw of the Nick Yarris story is Yarris himself: a captivating, labyrinthine storyteller with a sharp eye for the absurd. As he stands on the rehearsal room stage, in a theatrical recreation of his home for 22 years, it’s hard not to think the experience would be triggering. But Yarris insists not. “Through a series of meticulous, polite behaviours, you can actually erase all of the pathogens back to the trauma,” he says. “I’ve gotten so good at it. Death row is like this memory of a movie I’ve watched a long time ago a lot, and I know all the parts of the film, but none of it bothers me.” These days, Yarris has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disorder thought to be caused by repeated blows to the head. It mixes uneasily with his aphasia, which can impair the way he communicates, and which dates back to a traumatic incident in his childhood. “Nabokov’s message is true: our life can really be an artful thing if we’re the projectionist and not the screen upon which someone else projects us,” says Yarris. “I know I’m not supposed to be here. I’ve been shot, strangled, I hung myself on death row. I’ve been beaten and stabbed multiple times. I flipped a car over in 2022 in a wreck that I should have never walked away from. And I had to have brain scans for the next two years, telling me that right now I got a plaque buildup on my brain threatening to just eviscerate me at any moment.” Yarris turns to address Brody directly, the emotion obvious. “We just had a moment in the other room,” he says. “I walked up to one of the most beautiful men I know and I looked him in the face, and I thanked him for taking away every fucking punch, kick, everything they did to me. I looked him in the eyes with honesty, and I said, ‘I can let go now.’ You see, my biggest fear wasn’t surviving death row. It was that I would die before I could tell my story. Most people who suffered deep trauma, that’s their biggest fear: no one will hear me. No one will ever understand this pain or know what it was that I became. “I am being given a once-in-a-lifetime gift,” Yarris goes on, looking into Brody’s eyes, “and although it’s humbling to be eulogised in front of yourself, I fucking earned it.” Brody interjects tenderly, “That’s right.” Yarris repeats, “I fucking earned it.” The idea for the play came to Ferrentino during the Covid pandemic. The American playwright, best known forUgly Lies the Bone, which was a hit in New York and at the National Theatre in London in 2017, watched the documentary ofThe Fear of 13and was compelled by Yarris’s voice and his extraordinary lack of bitterness and self-pity. “It was during lockdown, and I was craving theatre, and it felt like theatre to me: just a man in a chair telling his life story,” she recalls. “I did think I could, naively, get the rights to that, whack it on stage and call it a day and have a new play.” Beyond that, though, there was the drama of Yarris’s extreme sliding-doors moment: why oh why, you want to scream, did he claim to know the killer? This sensation is made more profound when you learn that he was fully exonerated of the original crime that he was jailed for and would have walked free aged 21. “In the writing of it, the big theme that kept coming out was that every person is a few decisions away from having a completely different life,” says Ferrentino. “Everyone lives on a precipice of having their fate or their life choices be completely different. And Nick’s story is, I think, a big example of that.” The play,The Fear of 13, became then not a monologue, but a more complex redemption narrative told through the relationship between Yarris and his girlfriend Jackie Schaffer, who met him in prison when she volunteered for a charity campaigning to abolish the death penalty. An ensemble cast fill out the assorted judges, drug dealers and fellow inmates that steered his life in different ways. Ferrentino was in discussion with Brody about another project when she suggested he might like to play Yarris. It was a long shot: Brody started performing in theatre productions in New York aged 12, but hadn’t acted on stage for more than 30 years. Besides, their accents are different – Brody is from Queens; Yarris has a strong Philadelphia twang – and they don’t much look alike, either. But Ferrentino never saw the character as an impersonation. “First of all, it should be said that I thinkAdrien Brodyis a once-in-a-generation talent,” she says. “He’s open-hearted, deeply intelligent, very sensitive, very intellectual, but also very street smart, cunning, clever, witty. You can believe he would rob you, but you can also believe he would read Tolstoy. And Adrien is the only person I can think of that can do all those things, that can play an ex-con and can play a concert pianist. “And that’s what Nick is. He has the soul of a poet, but a criminal history and is a brilliant, sensitive, open-hearted romantic and has had really hard circumstances, and used to be in prison fights, but also used to go back to his cell and read great literature and fall in love. It’s a cliche about containing multitudes, but that’s the most succinct way of saying it: both Nick and Adrien Brody contain the same multitudes.” Brody signed on forThe Fear of 13in a week. Why? “I’ve been open to doing theatre for some time, but I’ve been waiting to find something that touched me and this came out of the blue,” he says. “Lindsey and I were discussing something else, but she proposed this, and I was so moved by it. The first 10, 15 times I read the script, I could not get through it without crying.” Another motivation was the deeper societal resonance of the story for Brody. “The system is broken… Hey Nick, did you read about that poor Japanese man who just served 50-some-odd years?” he says over his shoulder to Yarris, referring to Iwao Hakamada, who was convicted of four murders in 1966 but finallyacquitted and releasedlast month. “He’s 88 or something, let out of prison. And they most likely planted evidence and tortured him into a confession. How could anyone grasp that? It’s impossible.” “It’s worse than dying,” adds Yarris. “I asked to die rather than linger.” In preparation for the play, Brody and the rest of the cast visited Belmarsh, a high-security prison in south-east London. “And if everybody wasn’t staring at me, I could have just wept, because of how soul-robbing it is,” says Brody. “You’re surrounded by all these people who have no opportunity and are all needing love and appreciation and have made some dumb mistake in their life and are being punished for that.” He turns to Yarris: “You’re miraculous, that’s what I’m trying to get at.” Brody, who is being paid the standard Donmar wage for his performance, has so far enjoyed the experience – for the most part. When he first arrived in London, he lived in the flat above the rehearsal room: it was a short commute but the whole experience was perhaps too intense. “It was like a Spike Jonze movie,” he smiles, referencing the director ofBeing John Malkovich. “I do mostly independent films and it’s far from what people imagine the experience of a quote-unquote Hollywood actor. It’s just not anything to do with the perception of what it is. But theatre is even more!” He laughs. “Theatre, you’re living in the attic and you’re working in the basement, and you don’t leave and nobody brings you lunch. You go out and you’ll get a sandwich at Tesco, and you munch it down and try to absorb all this material and try to represent so much. And you’re with 10 other people doing the same and it is quite wonderful. I found it to be very gratifying – somewhat frightening, but gratifying – to face that.” With the production moving into the theatre, and Brody leaving the attic, there’s no hiding from the fact that this is really happening now. This is especially unavoidable at the Donmar Warehouse, which packs 251 audience members into a venue where no seat is more than four rows from the stage. Its fame has spread far and wide, especially under Sam Mendes in the 1990s and Michael Grandage in the 2000s, with still-talked-about performances from Nicole Kidman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law and Ewan McGregor. “Nicole Kidman was naked in it!” says Brody. “Adrien Brody was nearly naked in it! It did feel like hallowed ground when I first stepped in. But once it’s live, it’s sink or swim. And I don’t like to sink, so I better start swimming.” Even beforeThe Fear of 13opened it was a smash: tickets for all performances for its two-month run sold out almost instantly. I point out, half-seriously, to Brody that he didn’t really need to do this interview, because the Donmar couldn’t sell any more seats. But he turns momentarily serious. “We did need to do this,” he replies. “We don’t need the publicity. But we need to honour what this is and also to respectfully portray something like this that is really important to be on people’s radars.” The clamour for tickets would not have been harmed by reviews coming from last month’sVenice film festivalthat suggest Brody is now a weighty favourite for a second Academy Award. The film isThe Brutalist, a mesmerising, blind-siding epic from Brady Corbet, a child actor turned director, that runs at three-and-a-half hours with a 15-minute intermission and was made for just $10m. Brody plays László Tóth, a fictional Jewish-Hungarian architect of the Bauhaus school who emigrates to the United States after the second world war and stutteringly tries to rebuild his life and career. Peter Bradshaw in theGuardiandescribedBrody’s turn as “a career best for him, surely, and an advance on his performance in Roman Polanski’sThe Pianist”. Brody does not shrug off the praise: it clearly means a lot to him. Around a decade ago, he admitted that he found himself sometimes disillusioned with the scope of the work he was being offered and his lack of control over the process. He turned to painting as a creative outlet. But over time, he has rekindled his love for acting: starting with roles in the superior television seriesPeaky Blinders,SuccessionandWinning Time:The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty, and his fruitful, ongoing collaboration with Wes Anderson, and now withThe Fear of 13andThe Brutalist. “The Brutalisthas given me… I think I’d been yearning for a role of that calibre, and a director of that calibre to honour the character,” says Brody. “It’s not simply in an actor’s hands. And Brady did just that. It’s not like I haven’t been working towards that. You have to continue. And I’ve worked with wonderful people. I’m not diminishing the work. It’s just,The Pianistwas a triumph, and it was a real achievement. And this had far fewer means, and is a very different journey. It’s a remarkable thing.” Yarris listens in intently, and they fall into a good-natured spat about how bullish Brody should be about the Oscars. Yarris particularly liked his performance as Luca Changretta, the Italian-American mobster who shows up halfway throughPeaky Blinders. “Do me a favour,” Yarris chides the actor. “You’re fucking Adrien Brody. Own it! When you walk in there to collect your hardware, the head is up, the chin is up, and I want you to fucking own it!” Brody mutters: “If that day comes… ” “‘If’ is a weak word,” Yarris fires back, “whenmy day comes again. You are Luca Changretta, what the fuck!” “I’ve got to be more Luca Changretta,” Brody accepts. Here, there is a parallel with Yarris: as Brody was winning his Oscar in 2003, Yarris was on the final push to overturn his conviction. The intervening years have been something of a mixed bag. He moved to the UK in 2005 and has since lived in the woods in Oregon and latterly in Los Angeles in a camper van. He’s been married, divorced; fallen in and out of love. He’s been rich, after his multimillion-dollar settlement, and not. He wants to write more books and he’s working to develop a television series calledKings of the Gallows. “Can I tell you?” says Yarris, gazing over at Brody. “It’s so important that you know how happy I am now, Adrien. Dude, I don’t cry for any of it, so you don’t have to. Like, I love you for the feelings that you’re investing in all this. But man, I’m smashing it now. I got the most beautiful girl in the world in love with me. I’m literally walking around London the last week with smiles that are aching my face. I’m happy as shit, man. I’m being honest, it’s so sweet.” Yarris hasn’t seenThe Fear of 13play yet: he’s realised there’s little point trying to micromanage his life any more. Whatever happens next, it can’t be stranger or harder than what he’s faced down already. “I’m getting all these beautiful rewards for doing something that a lot of us should do anyway,” he says. “I held on to my humanity, no matter what. It’s the only thing I’m proud of. In fact, I allowed death row to enhance it.”",Tim Lewis
culture,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/13/biyi-bandele-legacy-yoruba-boy-running,2024-10-13,‘He knew this was going to be the last story he wrote’: the epic legacy of literary maverick Biyi Bándélé | Books | The Guardian,,"In early August 2022, Biyi Bándélé had a conversation with his editor, Hannah Chukwu, about the novel he was working on,Yorùbá Boy Running, after which he sent her a revised version of the manuscript. On the following day, the 54-year-old film-maker, playwright and novelist took his own life, leaving behind an impressive and strikingly varied body of work: the film adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’sHalf of a Yellow Sun, which took seven years to make; stage versions of Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart, Aphra Behn’s Oroonoko and Lorca’s Yerma; poetry, screenplays and several novels including 2007’s Burma Boy, which told the story of his father’s harrowing and brutal experiences as a British army soldier in the second world war. His was a talent unrestrained by genre, medium, geography or period.  Yorùbá Boy Running tells the story of Samuel Àjàyí Crowther, whose life spanned the 19th century and took him from abduction and enslavement, via abandonment in Sierra Leone, back toNigeriaand a life in the clergy that ended with him becoming the first black bishop to be ordained by the Anglican church. In his foreword to the book, the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, whose play Death and the King’s Horseman was Bándélé’s final film adaptation, points to the intensely imaginative and vivid approach the novelist took to his subject. His “mix of the anecdotal, archival and inquisitional” style parts company, says Soyinka, with “the slave narratives to which we are more accustomed. It disorientates, yet inducts one, at a most primary level of intimacy, and even self-identification, into the realities of capture, enslavement and displacement; eases one deftly into a milieu of the slaving occupation as an existential norm, and one that was near inextricably intertwined with the trajectory of colonialism in west Africa.” The actor and novelist Paterson Joseph first encountered Bándélé when he was cast as the lead character, Busi, in Bándélé’s 1993 television play Not Even God Is Wise Enough, which was directed by Danny Boyle. Busi is “a sort of Billy Liar figure”, explains Joseph, in and out of trouble and taking refuge in a fantasy life. “Those stories that we went through, and the world that he inhabits, is a world of the absurd, which was very surprising when you think about 1993, how few black protagonists we had on British television that weren’t cliched in some way. This character had a real sadness about him and yet he was very, very funny because of his bewilderment about the world. He’s a man in search of his father, in basic terms, and he’s also a boy, really, in search of himself.” Joseph recalls a scene in which Busi is in a subterranean public lavatory and, apparently, encounters Dr Livingstone; another in a courtroom, where he wanders across the lawyers’ benches. “There’s something about his writing,” says Joseph. “It’s sort of maverick: it knows the rules, but it wants to disobey the rules to see what happens.” Bándélé’s daughter Temi is an artist who has just graduated with a first from Ruskin College in Oxford. Part of her portfolio, she and her mother, the producer Andrea Calderwood, tell me, is a steel sculpture called “Ajebutter”, a Nigerian expression for a child who’s slightly spoiled. Laughing, Calderwood remembers Bándélé warning her against putting butter in Temi’s food when she was being weaned lest she turn into an ajebutter. She also recalls the couple bringing a just-born Temi on to the red carpet at Cannes when one of Andrea’s films was featured at the festival: “People still ask me, ‘How’s the baby?’ Such a strong image of Temi there in her pouch. I say, ‘She’s 22.’ That’s how people remember us. But it didn’t really cross our minds that that was an unusual thing to do, to take Temi with us. For me, it was fantastic. Biyi really encouraged me to be brave about that.” Discover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories. Literary delights delivered direct to you after newsletter promotion Temi recalls her father exhorting her to read, watch and listen from as wide a cultural palette as possible from a very young age. When she was a schoolchild, he would – unbeknown to her – submit pieces of her creative writing to competitions; as a young man, after he had left his home town of Kafanchan in northern Nigeria for Lagos, he had done the same for himself. More recently, Temi would help with his research, borrowing books from the London Library and then dispatching them to him wherever he was. Bándélé lived in numerous places, often photographing and documenting life from New York, Lagos and Brixton. Calderwood has been struck by his focus on the multiple strands in Samuel Àjàyí Crowther’s life, and relates it to Bándélé’s own sense of himself: “That’s something that’s struck us lately, going back through the story of his life, and going back through the photographs: all the different identities that Biyi embodied. And I think that’s something that he always wanted to impart to Temi, that everything’s possible.” It’s a sentiment that’s echoed by Bándélé’s longtime friend and the outgoing artistic director of the Young Vic,Kwame Kwei-Armah: “It’s his searing intellect and his inability to want to compromise on form or message. When many of us were very specifically black or very specifically British, he was really global in that he was Nigerian and he was British and he looked at the world in an expansive way, so that identity wasn’t a kind of narrow binary. The play that changed nearly everything for me was his adaptation of Aphra Behn [in 1999]. That was a perfect combination of dramaturgical rigor and poetic heart, at a time where we were not used to all of those things coming out of a black mind. I just remember seeing it at the RSC, and then listening years later to the recording that the BBC made. He’d written with such an insight into the human spirit.” Chiwetel Ejiofor, who starred in Half of a Yellow Sun and who narrates the audiobook of Yorùbá Boy Running, also speaks of Bándélé’s penchant for weaving together different registers in his work, sometimes drawing on melodrama and soap opera to narrate difficult experiences, always playing with light and shade: “Pre-civil war, post-independence Nigeria was a very specific area that Biyi was interested in, it spoke to him quite profoundly. The philosophical, intellectual dynamics that were at play at that time in Nigeria influenced him and he was very excited to explore that. He also brought with him a certain humour and distinct aesthetic that I think is interesting – and very surprising.” When Temi was about five, there was an exhibition of Benin bronzes to which her father took her, along with a camping stool and paper and pencils; he sat her down to draw them. It’s evident from all she and Andrea tell me that creativity was Bándélé’s key mode for interpreting and understanding the world. “Yorùbá Boy Running is an epic novel,” Calderwood says. “And I think he lived his life on a grand scale.” I ask them whether they think that his creative restlessness, his constant search for the next artistic challenge, would have allowed him to be happy with the completed novel, given his death by suicide. Temi believes so: “He knew it was going to be the last words that he was writing. And you can really feel the energy of that; he knew that this was going to be the last story that he wrote. And he made sure that we knew that it was finished, and he made it very clear that he wanted it to be published.” What do they hope for this final work? “He really wanted it to be the beginning of multiple conversations that would happen when he wasn’t here,” says Temi. “I think he was ready to give that to the world.” Calderwood adds: “He started writing at 13, so he had been writing for 40 years. And he’d achieved so much in that time with his novels and his plays and his films, he had told so many stories. I love the way that Temi’s putting it: this was the conversation that he wanted to start, because conversation with Biyi could be endless.” In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

culture,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/oct/13/hew-locke-what-have-we-here-british-museum-procession-tate,2024-10-13,‘It’s quite a thing to do a show here and openly use the word looting’: artist Hew Locke on decolonising the British Museum | British Museum | The Guardian,,"Within the oak-panelled walls and glass display cases of the Enlightenment Gallery of theBritish Museum– a long, impossibly high-ceilinged room that is a temple to the gods of reason and imperialism – there is a little unmarked secret door, leading backstage or who knows where. You would never spot it unless you were looking. But for the rest of the autumn – for the first time in its 200-year history – that door will be symbolically flung open and three raucous figures will be emerging from it, invading the hushed space of marble busts and dinosaur fossils and leather-bound books. Leading the charge will be a young child of indeterminate heritage, in rags and patches, calling the others on. The figures emerge not only from the secret door but from the imagination of the artist Hew Locke, who was recently sitting with me on a low leather seat nearby, one quiet early morning before the museum opened, explaining, with half a smile, how it will look. “There are three figures but the sense is that this is just the advance guard, there are hundreds more behind, you know, like ahorde,” he says. “The child is holding a medal, an enlargement of a medal that was given to soldiers in east and west Africa, to theBenin expeditionguys [who plundered that country’s riches]. And he has a little armband with a very crude plastic replica of the Koh-i-noor diamond. It’s a mix-up, a messing around with colonial history, a messing around with ideas of the collection here.”  Locke turns 65 today, 13 October. A tall man, with a straggly mutton-chop beard and wise eyes, he has waited a working lifetime to do a bit of that mixing up. Born in Edinburgh to a black Guyanese father – the sculptorDonald Locke– and the white British painter Leila Locke, he spent his formative years in his father’s newly independent homeland before returning to the UK to study. When he arrived back here in the early 1980s he would, he says, often wander the rooms of the British Museum, “doing my thinking” – a habit that is nicely summed up in the title of his forthcoming revolutionary exhibition at the mother of all museums: what have we here? “I have been coming here for decades and decades,” he says, in a voice that still carries the leisurely cadences of Georgetown, Guyana. “I would find a place that was less crowded and just walk around and make up stories for my work, have ideas, forget ideas, imagine stuff, destroy plans, and somehow – through that process – something would stick.” What sort of thing was he thinking back then? “I hadn’t really evolved my ideas,” he says. “But I grew up in a post-colonial society. I saw Guyana being created. I saw banknotes being created. I arrived just in time for independence, and knew what had been there before. But then coming to London, I realised that although we [Guyanese] knew all about this place, this place didn’t know anything about us. And that was quite a shock, the lack of a two-way thing.” The stately marble halls of the British Museum, engine room of modern western civilisation, crystallised that thinking. Locke remembers a few formative realisations. Here’s one: why is Egypt never described as being in Africa? “A simple thing like that. The answer, I guess, is because they wanted Africa to mean something different. And then you realise the fact that some of the Egyptian Pharaohs were Nubian, they were black men. And then after that, well, everything is up for questioning.” TheEnlightenment Gallery, designed by Sir Robert Smirke in the 1820s, originally housed the library of the recently deceased King George III. It was conceived as the physical embodiment of the age of reason, the place where aristocratic British collectors dramatised their hierarchical view of the world and of human history, with themselves – natch – at the apex, in marble, on plinths. The museum’s collection of objects began with the bequest of Sir Hans Sloane. His interest in bringing home treasures and curiosities from Indigenous communities and the classical world began when he worked as a physician on Jamaican slave plantations, the riches from which fuelled his compulsive collecting. A marble bust of Sloane – latelyremoved fromits pedestal and housed in a cabinet – looks down on me and Locke as we are talking. “The Enlightenment room is acting as a bit of a trailer for the rest of my show,” says Locke. “It is a very important place –obviously– but seriously lacking incolour. And I’ve always found that whole concept of enlightenment,” he stretches the word out, sceptically, “shall we say, interesting. Because these people weren’t very enlightened, or only narrowly enlightened.” It goes without saying, I suggest, that in every sense they saw the world in terms of black and (unblemished) white? “They did. I wrote a thesis back in the 1990s about how different the world we live in might be if all the original colourful paint had remained on Greek and Roman statues.” It’s funny, he suggests, that people are still so shocked by the idea that those white marble busts and figures of theParthenonmarbles (otherwise known as the Elgin marbles), for example – were coloured in. “They just won’t accept it no matter how you try to sell it.” One ambition of Locke’s is to bring some of that colour back into the museum – not least the range of skin tones that classical statuary once embodied. His exhibition will be, you might say, something of a sequel, or endpoint, to the triumphant and carnivalesque figures inThe Procession, which memorably weaved their way through Tate Britain two years ago (described in afive-star reviewby Laura Cumming as “a tremendous spectacle … and most profound endeavour”). In the process by which galleries and museums re-evaluate the colonial roots of their collections and thinking, Locke has become something of a Prospero figure, magicking up the stuff that dreams – and nightmares – of empire were made of. Key to the new show will be a series of 11 oversized sculptural figures called The Watchers, who will perch in the fabric of the museum, observing visitors as they wander. “You’ll see them on top of the shelves and so on,” says Locke. “They’re watching your reaction, sometimes pointing at you, maybe judging you – or are they judging you? How complicit is the viewer in this place? Who is looking at who?” To create the exhibition, Locke and his partner, studio curator Indra Khanna, have been visiting the British Museum for more than two years, examining objects in the stores, working closely with more than 20 specialist curators. When I ask him if he had full access to the museum’s vast underground vaults, he laughs. “There’s a story,” he says. Three months after he began, headlines about the museum’s Greek and Roman antiquities curatorPeter Higgsemerged, reporting his arrest for allegedly stealing more than 1,000 precious objects from those stores over a 30-year period, and putting some for sale on eBay. (Higgs, who maintains his innocence, is being sued by the museum over the loss of the objects.) “Conversations about the collection kicked into a pretty high gear then,” recalls Locke. “And security too. I was like: OK, what did I agree to here?” That change of context didn’t stop him fossicking. “Sometimes I’d think, bloody hell, we’ve got to have that,” he says. “For example, this Portuguese cannon, seized in Benin. A strangely beautiful thing … ” Locke has created evocative clusters of objects, inviting connections about empire and power. Many of the 100 or more items he has brought out from the back rooms were suggestions from curators, he says, who knew how their stories or provenance chimed with his desire to “pick at the scab” of where things came from, and how, and why. “They were all: ‘Have you seen this?’ – and there were some difficult stories, not all happy, joy, joy. Not at all.” One good example of the complicated history of some objects is theAsante Ewer, a bronze jug made for Richard II in the 1390s, which at some unknown point in the subsequent years of Gold Coast trade and slavery ended up as a sacred object in the royal palace in Kumasi (in present-day Ghana) before being looted and brought home by imperial British troops in 1896. “It’s quite a thing,” says Locke, in passing, “to be doing a show in this place, where you openly use the words loot and looting in the description of certain objects. Because you can’t hide it any more.” Featuring four overlapping themes – sovereigns and icons of nationhood, trade, conflict and treasure – the exhibition offers visitors their own choice of route through it. His intention is to make what once seemed set in stone feel more provisional. “The whole exhibition,” he says, “is designed to look in part like it’s a series of packing crates, alluding to storage, to transport.” I’m reminded of thelast time I met Locke, back in 2015 in his south London studio, when he was preparing for a New York show loosely themed around migration, and was surrounded by a homemade flotilla of large improvised wooden boats, which were a kind of emotional imperative: the first, a replica of the imperial barge of the maharajah of Jaipur, he had made for his degree show at the Royal College of Art. “Here’s the thing,” he said then, “Guyana means ‘land of many waters’ – you are constantly aware of boats. I went to Guyana as a five-year-old kid on a boat. I came back here on a boat. I went to Falmouth to study art based on the fact that it looked like something I knew. Every three years I would need, psychologically, to make a boat. You can’t say why one thing means something to you. It’s that mix of politics and the personal that you are looking for, so that it flows in and out.” He has subsequently channelled that internalised ebb and flow – the trade routes by which objects and people have travelled – in resonant ways. The current show will feature, for example, Locke’s Souvenir series: reworked 19th-century mass-produced busts of figures from the British royal family, decorated by him with the paraphernalia of imperial rule, embroidery and jewels but also replicas of medals, coins and other souvenirs of overseas conflict. Did he, I wonder, start with a kind of disruptive wishlist at the museum? “There’s a limit to what you can do,” he says. “You know I can’t gut the Duveen Gallery and take out all the Elgin marbles and show it as it could be if – and when – they go back to Greece.” Were there frustrations? “You start with, like, how far can I push these guys?” he says. “From the institution’s point of view, their reputation is on the line; and from my point of view, my reputation is on the line.” Locke’s intervention at the museum comes at a critical time in these debates over provenance and ethics and ownership. “We live in a different world to the pre-pandemic world,” he suggests. “Pre-pandemic, everybody tried to talk a good game about decolonising the museum and stuff like that. Since the pandemic and Black Lives Matter, people think: ‘Well, hang on, we have to put our money where our mouth is.’” after newsletter promotion Locke’s exhibition is the first under the stewardship of the museum’s new directorNicholas Cullinan– who recently oversaw the inspiredrevampof the National Portrait Gallery – and who has spoken of how “this universal museum is not [yet] universal enough”. Cullinan has inherited the show, so is he fully on board with all its themes? “We haven’t completely had that type of conversation,” says Locke. “But we have bonded on certain things, for sure.” He agrees that it marks more than a moment; it is the beginning of irreversible re-evaluation. “And to be fair, despite my critiques of institutions like this over the years, it’s a brave thing to do, because you are not quite sure where it’s going to end up.” By way of example, he points to the Taíno carvings – 15th-century wooden sculptures from Jamaica of which the British Museum holds nine examples. “For Jamaica this is the Elgin marbles, you know, they want them back. There are lots of debates that will be had in the future.” One of his aims is to give a sense of the sheer volume of such treasure that the museum holds from the former pink parts of the globe, much of it never on display. “I wanted the show to feel full of stuff,” he says. “So it doesn’t become an academic exercise aesthetically.” Locke deconstructs the idea that the museum is orderly and academic as a post-rationalisation of the looting it partly represents. “If you work here, you obviously love the objects – but the way you display certain things, like a display of gold coins or something like that, isrestrained. It wouldn’t be, let’s have 500 of them – that’s more an artistic approach. But when you’re invading a country or taking over a civilisation, shall we say, you definitely wantplenty. You want all the gold you can grab. You’re not really concerned about what this means, culturally or whatever – bollocks to that.” He recalls his partner, Khanna, talking about watchingAntiques Roadshow. “People would always be saying, oh, I went up into the attic and I found this thing that great-uncle so-and-so picked up in this colony. And the antiques expert would say this is a wonderful example of this or that. And then it goes into auction, bish, bosh, done. I don’t think you can do that any more. These days, the first thing people might think is, where did it come from? That question is going to be asked more and more.” I remember talking to former British Museum director Neil MacGregor about these issues ages ago, I say, and his argument, broadly, was that the museum was the world’s memory bank, the place where people from the world’s four corners make connections about shared history. Is what he is doing another expression of that idea? “Yes,” he says. “From a museological point of view, this could be seen as the world’s problem. You can ignore it. You can bury your head in the sand. But as soon as you start looking and thinking, the whole thing becomes highly political. I was on holiday last year in Athens and went to visit the Parthenon Gallery. I was walking around thinking: ‘Shit, this is the most political museum I’ve ever been in.’” In what sense? “There were all these casts of the Elgin marbles interspersed with the odd few they managed to hang on to. My wife was walking behind this American tour group and she heard someone say, ‘God, what must it be like to be British walking around here? Imagine the guilt.’ But that’s the same for any encyclopedic museum in Europe or America. There are certain things you expect to see, and now all those things are problematic. What do you do? If I was a young lawyer, I’d be thinking, ‘Boy, let me go into property law of this nature, there is going to be work for me for a long time.’” Against that complication, I suggest, it’s clear that he wants his exhibition to be exuberant rather than preachy or earnest? “It’s not a miserable show,” he says. “I’ve dealt all my life artistically with these kinds of difficult things, but we can’t live in misery. Hence my work looks the way it looks. Life is tough enough.” Then again, if Hew Locke was in charge, would he be sending, for example, the controversial Benin bronzes back home tomorrow? “I can’t not send them back. Accepting the fact that I’d be sad to see them go, because I can get on a bus and come down here. My mother told me about those bronzes when I was a child. In Guyana, in 1969, that was a very unusual thing for somebody to be talking about.” And would he accept the fact that if they did go back, far fewer people would ever get to see them? “That’s the debate that people often bring up. But then the thing is, would it not be a boost to tourism in Benin? I heard of a group in the US, radical activists, an African-American group, saying, well, these things should stay here, because this stuff is what was used to trade us into slavery. So there are all sorts of arguments and debates. But the thing is, if it was down to me, I’d be giving them back.” Did he ever think he would see the day when statues of slave traders, say, ended up in the bottom of harbours? “It’s funny,” he says. “I remember driving through Bristol with a friend back in the 80s, and as we went past the statue of Edward Colston, I said casually: ‘That’s got to go.’ But when it came down I was in shock. It’s the same thing in this building. Certain things feel like a fixture, sure. Some of them are literally almost immovable, but they have been moved before.” He recognises, of course, that a lot of people who feel threatened by that knowledge – the sense that culture is an ongoing argument, not something set in stone – would defend “our heritage” at all costs and might fear the implied message of his exhibition. What, I wonder, does he say to them? He smiles. “Don’t panic!” he says. “I’m not saying that if you give certain things away, you won’t notice it. But at the same time, there’s lots more stuff here, and wonderful, sharp curators. Things will change, you know?” He gestures around the Enlightenment Gallery. “This may look different in 20 years’ time. But that’s how the world works.”",Tim Adams
culture,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/13/changingman-paul-weller-reinvents-himself-again-as-an-actor-in-steve-mcqueens-blitz,2024-10-13,Changingman Paul Weller reinvents himself again… as an actor in Steve McQueen’s Blitz | Paul Weller | The Guardian,,"The BFI London film festival spearheaded its opening gala last week withBlitz, the new film by Steve McQueen, the Oscar and Bafta-garlanded writer-director ofHungerand12 Years a Slave. Blitz, which will be released in cinemas from 1 November and then on Apple TV+, is set in the second world war, with strong resonance for our modern volatile climate. It tells the story of George (played by Elliott Heffernan), a nine-year-old mixed-race boy evacuated to the countryside for safety, who absconds to make his way back to his factory worker mother (Saoirse Ronan) in London.  Heffernan, 11, is not the only one making his screen debut. George’s grandfather is played by Paul Weller. Yes,thatPaul Weller – the musician and self-declared Beatles/1960s obsessive known as “the Modfather”, formerly of the Jam and the Style Council, and creator of 17 solo albums such asWild Wood(1993),Stanley Road(1995),On Sunset(2020), andthe latest,66, released earlier this year, the day before his 66th birthday. What’s more, Weller is getting glowing reviews: “An impressive debut” (theTimes); “Superb” (Deadline). Such a response is by no means de rigueur for the musicians-turned-actors. After all, for every mesmeric David Bowie in 1976’sThe Man Who Fell to Earth, there’s an oiled and glistening Sting strutting in what appears to be a futuristic adult nappy in David Lynch’sDune. IfBlitzis an unexpected move for Weller, it has paid off. You can also trust the connection between him and McQueen (who also made the award-winning Black British history anthologySmall Axe). Still, it’s quite the transformation for an artist who, in a five-decade-plus music career, never showed the remotest inclination to dabble in other artforms, least of all acting. One might even say it is a quintessentially anti-Weller move. Or is this a lazy misreading of Weller? Is it simply that British culture’s changing man has changed yet again? McQueen clearly saw something in Weller. At a press conference forBlitz, he said: “I just thought he had an authenticity to his face. He looks like a person from that time”. By email from the New York film festival, whereBlitzwas showing last week, McQueen tells me: “I needed someone with a certain weight and depth.” He says Weller prepared for the role by working with an acting coach. “Paul is extra-generous in his contribution to the film. His work with Saoirse and Elliott was particularly tender.” What are McQueen’s thoughts on Weller generally as a cultural force? “The fact that we are still talking about him after more than 50 years tells you he is a pillar in British culture.” Suggs of Madness, aka Graham McPherson, a friend of Weller’s since the 1970s, was in the studio with him when McQueen called. “Amazing to read he’s playing a grandad,” he laughs over the phone. “He’s dealt with being the Modfather. I don’t know how he’s going to deal with being the Mod-grandfather.” Suggs says Weller’s immediate reaction was uncertainty: “He seemed confused – about whether he wanted to be an actor … He was always going on about how he hated doing videos.” But he says Weller was intrigued, primarily about McQueen: “He’s got some respect for that guy as a film-maker.” Suggs was one of the artists who worked with Weller on66,which had lyric contributions from a number of artists. “It was very nice working with him. People see him as being tough, but he’s very easy going. A very charming, funny person. I’ve always liked his attitude, his work ethic, his constant drive to change and reinvigorate himself.” Few would deny that Weller is one of the major arteries of British music and culture. Still, looking at his trajectory, there’s also a marked pattern of almost bullish restlessness. Born in Woking, Surrey, to taxi driver John and cleaner Ann, his late father would become his manager, while his mother ran his fanclub. As he cut his teeth in the unfashionable environs of working men’s clubs, the Jam, the band he formed in 1972 with Bruce Foxton and Rick Buckler, were a suited, booted, punk-adjacent, mod-suffused clarion call to the times, pumping out songs such as Down in the Tube Station at Midnight, Going Underground, and The Eton Rifles, the track Old Etonian David Cameron said he liked. Get our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Friday after newsletter promotion Weller, not one for hanging back in the class war, responded in his signature bracing style: “It wasn’t intended as a fucking jolly drinking song for the cadet corps … ‘Which bit didn’t you get?’” When I interviewed Weller alongside Noel Gallagher around the recording ofFire & Skill, a 1999 album of Jam covers, Weller was similarly forthright about the politicos he’d encountered during his mid-80s involvement with the Labour party youth drive Red Wedge: “Once I met the people involved, I thought, ‘Get me out of here.’ Forget showbusiness, these people had egos the size of that barn.” Arguably, this uncompromising attitude runs through Weller’s creativity. In a move that makes grown men with feather cuts weep into their beer to this day, he audaciously broke up the Jam in 1982 to form the Style Council with Mick Talbot, accompanied on vocals by Dee C Lee, who was to become his wife. Purveyors of what was termed cappuccino-soul, the Style Council (the antithesis of Little Englanders, gadding about with jumpers tied around their necks) couldn’t have been further from the Jam. Likewise, when the Style Council’s fifth album was rejected by Polydor in 1989, it was because it was full of house beats, with acid jazz thrown in. It was followed by a tough period in the wilderness for Weller (“It needed to happen,” he told me bluntly; “it brought me down to earth”). He then went on to enjoy the fabled Modfather mid-90s solo resurgence, almost at times serving as a human junction between eras: from the black-and-white 60s music he loves (the Kinks, the Who, Small Faces, Northern Soul and US R&B), through to modern innovations and styles. Indeed, Weller’s solo albums have proved to be a diverse mix, incorporating soul, rock, house, psychedelia, and more. All of which eclecticism and experimentation seems at odds with the rather reductive “dad-rock” persona he, Gallagher, and even Paul McCartney are routinely lumbered with. Weller is very much a father (of eight children from four different relationships), but while the dad-rock tag isn’t without amusement, is it strictly fair or true? When I ask Suggs where he sees Weller in terms of culture, he mock-sighs: “I really don’t want to go on, because that’s not what we do – be nice to each other. David Bowie’s the epitome of all we dug about British culture, and I think he’s not far behind. You think of the Jam, then jumping right out with Style Council then going off on his own again and starting out playing those small clubs.” Could this be the explanation for Weller’s latest manoeuvre into film? Maybe not the dad-rocker. Maybe not even, for now, just a musician. And definitely not as first appeared, an anti-Weller move. Rather, as Weller has so often been, the creative embodiment of the classic shark philosophy: “Move forward or die”.",Barbara Ellen

About 50 people were demonstrating in Corowa, on the Murray River, on Saturday afternoon before police split them up.  A group of balaclava-wearing men were spotted huddled under a sign that read “white man fight back”. A video posted online showed the group’s leader suggesting white people were being “pushed out” of their towns. Police said no arrests were made but inquiries into the rally were continuing. “About 12.15pm [on Saturday] emergency services were called to Sanger Street, Corowa, following reports of an unauthorised assembly,” a statement read. “Officers attached to Murray River Police District attended and dispersed the crowd of about 50 people.” The deputy opposition leader,Sussan Ley, who is the local federal MP, condemned the rally but said she was heartened that residents had made it clear racism had no place in Corowa. “I am saddened this hate was forced upon members of my community, including many families who were simply enjoying their weekend, the day before the Corowa show,” Ley said. “It is clear this is part of a strategy to shock and provoke using regional towns … in recent months, similar activities have been rightly shut down in our cities.” Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion State and federal governments have banned Nazi symbols and gestures after concerns about a rise in antisemitism.

Wong called for Peter Dutton to clarify the Coalition’s position on the United States’ support for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon after the shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, distanced theCoalitionfrom the US stance.  “A few days ago, Mr Dutton said the prime minister should be condemned for calling for a ceasefire,” Wong said on Sunday, referring toDutton’s refusal to back a government motion in parliament on Mondaymarking the first anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks. “Now the Liberals finally realise they’re at odds with the international community, including the United States, who are all pressing for peace – but he [Dutton] still can’t bring himself to do so.” The opposition had rejected Monday’s parliamentary motion because it included the ceasefire call. Dutton argued the US no longer supported ceasefire calls. He claimed Australians would “condemn the prime minister” for taking a stance that was “at odds with some of our key partners”. But the US president, Joe Biden, and the vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, have since confirmedthe US still supports a ceasefire. On the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday, Paterson appeared to reverse the previous stance, saying there would be times when the allies would disagree. “It’s not a remarkable thing that Australia could come to a different judgment from the United States,” Paterson said. “We are our own sovereign country.” Wong said Dutton should clarify how he would have responded to the situation if he was prime minister. “Mr Dutton needs to explain: would he have stood against the US-led UN security council resolution which called for a ceasefire in Gaza? Would he have said no to Australia joining the United States and other partners in a statement calling for a ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border?” She accused Dutton of being “negative about everything”. “But it’s pretty extreme to be negative about a ceasefire that saves civilian lives and prevents further disastrous escalation of conflict,” she said. About 2,700 people fleeing conflict in Lebanon have now landed in Australia, as the federal government prepares to start ending flights. A year on from Hamas’ 7 October attack on Israel, fighting has widened in the region from Gaza to Lebanon, Yemen and Iran. Vice president Harris said her administration was working to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. Asked on Sunday about the Coalition’s position on a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, Paterson said it could only happen when Hezbollah had been “degraded and defeated”. This is at odds with Biden and Harris, who have called for a de-escalation and ceasefire. When questioned about being in disagreement with the nation’s closest ally, Paterson told Insiders: “It wouldn’t be remarkable for an Australian politician to disagree with an American politician, particularly the United States administration under President Biden and Vice President Harris, a centre-left administration.” “I’m from a centre-right political party, there’ll be times that we disagree, and mature adults can be open and honest,” Paterson said. He said that “on questions of principle, [the Coalition] are very strong supporters of Israel”. “We understand the circumstances they face. God forbid Australia ever faces challenges that Israel faces. God forbid that Australian politicians are ever faced with these choices, but if we would expect their government to respond as decisively as Israel has.” Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Asked if he wanted to see a ceasefire enforced, Paterson said the opposition wanted to see an end to the conflict. “In my view, that will only happen once Hamas releases the hostages and once Hamas is degraded, so they no longer pose an ongoing threat to Israel from Gaza,” he said.

About a month ago, Sara and her husband, Fadi*, left their Adelaide home to help their Afghan family members who are in Iran illegally, in hiding and in danger after fleeing the Taliban after the fall of Kabul in 2021.  Now, Israel iscontemplating retaliationfor Iran’srocket attacks, amid its escalating war with Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. The Australian government has told citizensnot to travel to Iran. There are risks of missile strikes, terrorist attacks, kidnapping and a “high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest,” according to the Smartraveller website. But Sara, 54, felt she had to go to help her mum, Rosina*, who is in her 70s, and to check on her other relatives. There are 16 of them – three families with seven children under 16 years old. The youngest is just five and pops her head into the video call with a cheeky smile. Rosina is one of 230,000 Afghans awaiting a decision from the Australian government on a visa that would ensure her safe passage to our shores, away from the reign of the Taliban in the region. In August 2021, after western troops withdrew fromAfghanistan, the Nazar family desperately tried to get on one of the few evacuation flights. “We attempted multiple times after the withdrawal to attend the airport, the gate that we were trying so hard to get to is instilled in our hearts,” one of the men, Faraz*, says through a translator. “It’s called Abbey Gate, the gate we never reached. “The Taliban would come right near us, and start firing the AK-47. The kids were screaming and yelling. They beat us with the AK-47s, pushed the women around. The kids got trampled.” Other direct family members – locally engaged employees working for Australia – got out. But those left behind were targeted by the Taliban. “The Taliban assaulted us. Our house was raided and that was the final straw. We knew we were in danger … it felt like the end of the world on the streets,” Faraz says. The family fled to Iran, holding on to a promise from Australia that they would be protected by their 449 visas – a temporary evacuation visa that was extended – with visa holders assured they would be prioritised in Australia’s humanitarian and refugee intake. According to the latest statistics, more than 250,000 Afghans have applied to the department of foreign affairs for a visa. About 20,000 of applications have been granted. The government has allocated 26,500 dedicated visa places for Afghans under its offshore humanitarian program through to 2026 and at least 5,000 through the family stream. The Dfat website says it is processing applications as quickly as they can, but that there are limited places. “We expect it may take several years to finalise all of those received in 2021,” it says. “We expect it will take at least six years from date of receipt for processing to commence on those lodged in 2022, 2023 or 2024.” Priority is being given to groups including locally engaged employees (LEEs), 449 visa holders and their family members. Meanwhile, Rosina hasn’t been able to see a doctor for years, too fearful of the danger outside her front door. “I had to come,” Sara says. “They have been inside the house for two years. They can’t go out. The police are deporting people, beating them. They disappear. “I went to the Australian embassy to get some answers … but they didn’t open the door to us. They said to call or email.” Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The family members that made it to Australia have been calling and emailing for years and the advice to the family has remained the same: go to the embassy. Asked if she’ll try to get out now that an Israeli attack seems imminent, Sara says she can’t. “How can I leave my mum, my family here? They need me. They need me to buy them food.” The Greens immigration spokesperson, David Shoebridge, says the Australian government has “failed to live up to” its responsibility to Afghans “after the generation-long invasion of Afghanistan”. “The Iranian regime is brutal. People from Afghanistan in Iran right now are not safe,” he says, adding that the government should have learned from the situation in Pakistan with deportations and focus on getting people out of Iran. “It was clear that the regime there would persecute people fleeing from Afghanistan,” he says. “The government did not act, and now people are in a deeply dangerous situation.” The danger is from both the threat of attack and from the deportations. The Iranian and Pakistani governments are rounding up Afghans and sending them back to the country they fled. A Dfat spokesperson said the government “remains committed to assisting Afghans who supported Australia’s mission in Afghanistan”. “The government … is extending all available effort to finalising certifications and visa applications for Afghan LEEs. If a person is certified as an Afghan LEE, the Department of Home Affairs will prioritise the processing of their humanitarian visa application,” the spokesperson said. The home affairs website says the government policy is to also prioritise the immediate families of LEEs. “There were promises made, very reluctantly, but they were made,” Shabnam Safa, from the Australian Hazara Advocacy Network, says. “Australia was involved there for 20 years. “You can’t help but feel that the whole Afghanistan matter has been completely deprioritised.” “We know people cannot get bread from local bakeries. They can’t get groceries – there are official signs saying we will not sell anything to Afghan refugees here. Let alone having no access to education, or employment, and constantly living in fear of being deported back to the Taliban.” The Nazar family say they fear deportation and death. “If you want us to die, we need to know that’s our destiny. Once they find us we will be deported,” Faraz says. “We’re losing faith that we’re going to be rescued.” *Names have been changed",Tory Shepherd

Research from the advocacy organisation Everybody’s Home showed on average renters in capitals are paying $14,700 more annually to rent a house, and $9,600 more to rent a unit compared with 2020.  Sydney and Perth have endured the steepest rent rises, with annual increases well above capital city averages for units ($10,452 and $14,508 respectively) and houses ($18,512 and $18,304). Adelaide and Brisbane unit rents are also above average. Everybody’s Home analysed rental data from SQM Research to build its report. Maiy Azize, a spokesperson from Everybody’s Home, said“keeping a roof over their head” is the biggest cost-of-living expense for most people in Australia. “The steep rise in rents is pushing more people into severe housing stress and homelessness,” Azize said. “People are sacrificing the necessities to afford the rent, living in appalling unhealthy conditions because there’s nowhere else for them to go, and ditching important life decisions because of housing insecurity. “Australians are being priced out of the cities where they work, which can affect the liveability of our cities and the quality of essential services.” One Sydney renter, Willimena, 60, lives in a sharehouse in Eastwood with her son and two others. Their rent goes up every year. “It went from $690 [a week] to $730 to $750 to $800 and the last one was going to be $900 but I was able to get it down,” she said. They now pay $850 after arguing no repairs had been made on the property and that they are good tenants. She is on a carer payment and works 15 hours a week at a vet clinic. “I’m struggling to pay bills, on top of rent and groceries. There are no luxuries.” If they get another increase, she will have to move further out, likely into another sharehouse, making it harder to get to work. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The most recent data from CoreLogic showed rents have reached a record high, with the national average now $627 a week, an 8.5% increase between May 2023 and 2024. Azize said a shortfall of 640,000 social homes was putting extra pressure on the rental market and pushing people into homelessness. “That is set to rise to nearly 1 million in two decades. We need to end the shortfall and turn social housing into an option for more Australians – not just a safety net for those at the margins.” Everybody’s Home wants the government to make changes to negative gearing and the capital gains tax, Azize said. Recent analysis by Guardian Australia showedthose earning over $180,000 benefited from a quarter of all negative gearing kickbacks, lowering their collective tax bill by $1.3bn in 2021-22. “Poll after poll shows that most voters want action on these investor tax handouts because they’re unfair and pushing up the cost of housing for everyone. Our supporters are excited by reports that Labor is open to change,” Azize said.",Cait Kelly
across-the-country,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/could-aboriginal-designed-housing-help-solve-the-health-crisis-in-remote-communities,,Could Aboriginal-designed housing help solve the health crisis in remote communities? | Rural Australia | The Guardian,,"It’s hotter inside than out in many of the homes in the remoteNorthern Territorytown of Tennant Creek, where the Warumungu man Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla and his family live. Most lack insulation and guttering. At Drive-in Camp outside town, the homes are tin sheds, disconnected from services since the 2007 intervention but still occupied. The poor housing is making the residents sick, Jupurrurla says: “I worry about the future – will my grandchildren and their kids be living in prison-like houses? Or are we going to start designing homes that allow us to practise our culture?”  A $1bn investment in remote housing in the NT since 2017 has failed to solve the problem. A further $4bn was pledged in March in a joint announcement by the federal and territory governments. But health experts warn unless authorities commit to a dramatic shift in the way housing is designed and built for Indigenous communities, public health outcomes could worsen. Poor housing has been blamed for high rates of rheumatic heart disease in the NT. The preventable condition is caused by repeated, untreated streptococcus A infections and is linked to poverty, overcrowded and inadequate housing and lack of access to healthcare. Australia has one of the highest rates of RHD in the world, and rates have doubled between 2012 and 2021. Jupurrurla says community participation in decision-making leads to better maintenance and a sense of ownership. He is the chair of Wilya Janta, a cultural consultancy and housing collective based in Tennant Creek which has developed housing designs by Aboriginal people for Aboriginal people. “For too long, we’ve been given houses we had no say in designing,” he says. Simon Quilty, a GP based in Tennant Creek, also works with Wilya Janta. He says nothing symbolises the failure of government housing design more clearly than steel trapdoors. These were introduced about five years ago to accommodate future air conditioning installations. But instead of providing relief from the heat they act as conductors, turning homes into ovens. “If you can’t afford an aircon, then you’ll have a heat-conducting steel plate making you need that aircon even more than if you did have the money to buy one,” Quilty says. “It is madness, these design lunacies make houses more expensive to build and injure the wellbeing of the resident for no possible gain, to save a few measly bucks.” Glenn Platt, the executive director of strategy and innovation at Emergent Group, says the metal trapdoor is like “having an extra glass window in the room”. The result is a home which is hotter inside than out, a significant health risk when temperatures are frequently above 40C. Overcrowded and poorly ventilated housing is a major driver of preventable diseases among Aboriginal communities, with more than half of all Indigenous people in the NT living in overcrowded homes. Dr John Paterson, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT, says poor housing contributes to the spread of infectious diseases, hampers early childhood development, affects mental health, and diminishes social and emotional wellbeing. “Diseases like rheumatic heart disease are better termed diseases of poverty; driven by overcrowded housing, lack of access to washing facilities and palatable drinking water that is unfortunately too common in remote communities, particularly in the central region,” he says. Overcrowded environments increase the chances of repeated exposure to streptococcus bacteria. While harmless on the skin’s surface or easily managed by antibiotics in communities with good access to health services, repeat infections can lead to immune reactions that scar heart valves. “We’re asking for the same basic human rights which include the same building standards, the same building repair and maintenance expectations, the same basic functions of a house – like access to suitable drinking water and a continuous power supply – that people living in any other jurisdiction in Australia take for granted,” Paterson says. “But for too long these standards have not been met in remote communities.” Most government-built homes in remote areas are built using concrete blocks. They have inadequate thermal efficiency, poor ventilation and minimal climate control. The new housing funding will pay for up to 2,700 new three-bedroom homes over 10 years. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese,said the program was designed to halve overcrowding in Indigenous communities in the NTas part of the Closing the Gap goals. Some 971 new or replacement homes have been built and 489 expanded under other funding deals since 2017. A federal Department ofHousingspokesperson said the new builds would be constructed after consultation with Indigenous communities and Aboriginal Housing NT. Skye Thompson, AHNT’s chief executive, told Guardian Australia the new homes must be appropriate for the climate and culture of those living in them. “When houses are built to a lower standard of energy efficiency and works are not subject to a proper certification process; when they are poorly oriented, too hot or stuffy; and when the design doesn’t suit the residents’ family configuration or culture, the return on investment nosedives,” she says. The NT minister for housing construction, Bill Yan, said the new Country Liberal party government, whichswept to victory in Auguston a platform that included reversing youth justice reforms andlowering the age of criminal responsibility to 10, reaffirmed the NT government’s commitment to the $4bn housing partnership with the federal government. “The partnership with the federal government is a signed agreement that the new government will honour,” he said. “Territorians living in safe housing is an important part to community safety as well as enjoying our Territory lifestyle. “We will listen to stakeholders and communities on their housing needs and consider expert advice on any issues prohibiting effective and efficient delivery of remote housing.”",Otis Filley

We call for these attacks to stop and recognise Israel’s right to defend itself. Australia urges the exercise of restraint and protection of civilian lives.” Peter Dutton, opposition leader “When people talk about Israel having to show restraint, it’s completely and utterly the wrong time for that sort of language … I think it’s important for us to speak in a bipartisan way, but the Coalition won’t be using any language about restraint from the Israeli people at the moment. Their focus is on defeating this scourge and making sure that they can recover their citizens.” Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens “The premeditated targeting of civilians by Hamas is a war crime, as is the bombing of Palestinian civilians by the state of Israel. All perpetrators of war crimes in this conflict must be held to account for their actions in accordance with international law. The Greens condemn the attacks and we condemn the occupation.” Anthony Albanese, prime minister “This was not just an attack on Israel. This was an attack on Jewish people. Let us be clear: Hamas is an enemy, but not just of Israel. Hamas is an enemy of all peace-loving Palestinian people who are left to pay a devastating price for this terrorism. Hamas honours no faith. It serves no cause but terror. It is no better than any other group in history that has clung to the twisted belief that victory can be built on the blood of the innocent … There is no question that Israel has the right to defend itself against a terrorist organisation and to take strong action against it, but we join the calls of President Biden and other partners for Israel to operate by the rules of war.” Peter Dutton, opposition leader “The Coalition joins with every other person of decent humanity in condemning this attack by Hamas militants on Israel. Israel has every right to exist. Israel has every right to defend itself and its people. Israel has every right to deter future attacks and other acts of aggression, of coercion and of interference. The Coalition supports, and proudly supports, Israel’s right to do what is necessary and needed in the circumstances, with every asset available to safeguard its sovereignty, to bolster its borders, to protect its people and to thwart the threats it now faces – the existential threats. There must be no restraint shown to those who have shown no restraint themselves in committing these vicious and vile acts of terrorism.” Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens “This looming humanitarian catastrophe is something that Australia should be joining other countries in trying everything we can to stop. We join with everyone in this parliament in mourning the 1,300 Israelis* who have lost their lives, but on today’s count there are also between 2,300 and 2,600 Palestinians who have lost their lives, many of who are children. And we mourn them as well. This is now moving beyond self-defence into an invasion, and it is up to Australia as a peace-loving country to join the push to stop it. No to antisemitism, no to Islamophobia and no to the war on Gaza.” * The Israeli death toll was later updated to be about 1,200 killed Penny Wong, foreign minister “Australia shares the grave concerns that I have articulated previously about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Human suffering is widespread, and it is unacceptable … This is a collective statement about the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire that the world is supporting. So, this is not a unilateral decision by Australia. We made a decision on the basis of the merits of this resolution to join along with many other countries to support the resolution at the General Assembly.” Simon Birmingham, Coalition foreign affairs spokesperson “War is terrible, and I grieve for absolutely every single life that is lost that is an innocent civilian, particularly those of children. But the reality is, if Israel just adopts the ceasefire that Anthony Albanese has now voted for, it will just give Hamas opportunity to re-arm, regroup and repeat. The terrorist atrocities all over again.” Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens “It’s not a ceasefire until the bombs stop dropping. The PM must fight like hell to make this ceasefire call a permanent reality. Not a pause before the slaughter starts again. A genuine, permanent ceasefire.” Penny Wong, foreign affairs minister “Our support for the ICJ and respect for its independence does not mean we accept the premise of South Africa’s case. We will continue to work for a just and enduring peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I would note Australia is not currently a party to the case and that at this stage the ICJ has not invited interventions from other parties.” Simon Birmingham, Coalition foreign affairs spokesperson “The Albanese government should rule out supporting South Africa’s unbalanced application against Israel to the ICJ. Mr Albanese has been wildly inconsistent in the positions his government has taken, with Labor deeply divided. Australia should maintain a strong commitment in support of Israel’s inherent right to self-defence after Hamas’s horrific targeting of civilians, while continuing to expect Israel to act with regard to international law.” Mehreen Faruqi, deputy leader of the Greens “Australia must publicly support South Africa’s genocide case against Israel in the international court of justice. The world is watching and Australians are demanding that Anthony Albanese put politics aside, show some guts and be remembered on the right side of history.” Penny Wong, foreign affairs minister “Australia is deeply concerned by allegations Unrwa staff may have been involved in the abhorrent October 7 terror attacks. We welcome Unrwa’s immediate response, including terminating contracts and launching an investigation, as well as its recent announcement of a full investigation into allegations against the organisation.” Peter Dutton, opposition leader “If she’s knowingly sent that money to a terrorist organisation, then I think that is an outrage, and I think Penny Wong and the prime minister have more questions than answers in relation to this particular issue.” Mehreen Faruqi, deputy leader of the Greens “The Labor government’s blatant hypocrisy is on full display – suspending funding to Unrwa while Palestinians are being killed, starved and displaced, but not so much as a slap on the wrist for Israel which is on a genocidal mission.” Anthony Albanese, prime minister “People would have seen the footage of the vehicle that was hit in this strike by an Israeli missile that clearly is identified as being from the World Central Kitchen. These vehicles were going about carrying the best of humanity, people who’d come from all over the world to help Palestinians who are suffering from extraordinary deprivation in Gaza. And for them to lose their life in these circumstances is outrageous and completely unacceptable. Humanitarian workers are protected under international law. And the Netanyahu government must publish a full and transparent investigation. And they must be held accountable.” Simon Birmingham, Coalition foreign affairs spokesperson “This is a tragedy. It shouldn’t have happened. It is wrong that it happened. We’ve been very clear about that. We have expectations in terms of the investigations that should occur. But we also cannot turn away or be so naive as to pretend that tragedies and mistakes don’t occur in war. They do. They happen all the time. It’s a terrible thing. We’d wish it wasn’t the case.” Mehreen Faruqi, deputy leader of the Greens “Israel’s targeting of a clearly identified convoy of aid workers is just one example of their attacks and undermining of aid agencies and workers. Just a phone call simply isn’t good enough. The Australian government must respond with actions, not words.” Penny Wong, foreign affairs minister “We all know one vote won’t, on its own, end this conflict. It has spanned our entire lifetimes. But we all have to do what we can to build momentum towards peace. I want to be extremely clear again. This vote is not about whether Australia recognises Palestine. We will do that when we think the time is right. What we would say, and what I do say, is Australia no longer believes that recognition can only come at the end of a peace process. It could occur as part of a peace process. I have been clear there is no role for Hamas in a future Palestinian state.” Simon Birmingham, Coalition foreign affairs spokesperson “The Albanese Labor government has proven overnight that they lack the courage to stand against pressure and by sound principles after voting at the United Nations general assembly for a resolution granting a unique form of UN membership to the ‘state of Palestine’. Labor’s support for the resolution sends a shameful message that violence and terrorism get results ahead of negotiation and diplomacy.” Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens “While the rest of the world moves towards recognising the State of Palestine, Labor’s refusal just sets us back. Recognising Palestine won’t by itself stop the slaughter in Rafah, the invasion, or the occupation; but it is an important step towards peace, equality and justice.” Anthony Albanese, prime minister “Well, I’m not about to go into hypotheticals about things that have not happened … There’s been an application. There’s been no determination by the ICC against any individual or anybody at this point in time.” Peter Dutton, opposition leader “I don’t rule it out [Australia withdrawing from the ICC] but I think the pressure at the moment needs to be for like-minded countries that share our values, to stand shoulder-to-shoulder, for there to be no difference, and to put pressure on the ICC, to make sure that this antisemitic stance that they’ve taken does not advance.” Adam Bandt, leader of the Greens “Australia must publicly support the ICC prosecutor’s bold decision to press for arrests. No one is above the law … What we do here matters. Labor cannot follow Joe Biden’s flagrant disregard for the independent court.” Peter Dutton, opposition leader “If people are coming in from that war zone and we’re uncertain about identity or their allegiances – Hamas is a listed terrorist organisation, they’ve just committed an atrocity against the Jewish people, the biggest attack on people of Jewish faith since the Holocaust – and that the government wouldn’t be conducting checks? I don’t think people should be coming in from that war zone at all at the moment. It’s not prudent to do so, and I think it puts our national security at risk.” Anthony Albanese, prime minister “There was a time when the Liberal party would have seen people fleeing, whether they were fleeing Ukraine, Israel, Syria, Vietnam, or Gaza at the moment, and would have had some understanding that this was the worst time to try to malign a whole group of people who are suffering enormously. It’s something that we see on our TV screens every night. This morning, if you turned on the radio, the latest hit was a school in Gaza, with real people devastated and losing their lives. When it comes to security processes, we have faith in our intelligence agencies.” Penny Wong, foreign affairs minister “Frankly, we were in a position where we were wanting to be able to vote for a resolution which did reflect closely the ICJ opinion, which gave impetus to a pathway to peace, and we worked very hard in New York with others, including the Palestinian delegation, to seek amendments that would enable us to support it, as we did the recognition vote and the ceasefire vote, where text enabled Australia to support it, and we were disappointed that the amendments that we and many others sought were not accepted. For that reason we abstained.” Peter Dutton, opposition leader “They should have voted with the United States … I think Penny Wong here is – and along with the prime minister, frankly – damaging our relationship very significantly with Israel, with the United States and with like-minded partners.” Mehreen Faruqi, deputy leader of the Greens “The Labor government has shown itself to be gutless fence-sitters by abstaining on a vote in the UN for Israel to end its occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. That is just plain cowardly.” Anthony Albanese, prime minister “A year on from October 7, Israelis and people across the world are mourning those who were robbed of their lives and futures and waiting anxiously for news of the hostages who remain in captivity. Palestinians are mourning the lives taken from them in the continuing aftermath. So much has been lost; so many loved ones buried. We join all of them in their grief.” Peter Dutton, opposition leader “So in the motion moved by the prime minister today are not just words of comfort and words of recognition in relation to October 7 – and I acknowledge those words in his motion. But of course, it goes beyond that, and it’s an extension of the way in which the prime minister has conducted the debate and himself over the course of the last 12 months, trying to please all people in this debate.” Australian Greens, written statement “We condemned the taking of hostages a year ago and we continue to condemn hostage-taking for the war crime that it is. The very same commitment to compassion, honesty, peace and justice required of us in response to those attacks of Hamas requires us as Greens to call out the war crimes and genocide that is being carried out by the State of Israel right now in Gaza and the rest of the occupied territories and the bombing and invasion of Lebanon.”",Daniel Hurst

Thenational vaccination insights projectsurveyed 2,000 Australian parents of children under five between March and April and found the biggest barrier to turning declining vaccination rates around were the practical difficulties parents face.  Dr Katarzyna Bolsewicz, one of the lead investigators of the project which is a collaboration between the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), the University of Sydney and the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, said the project offers the first ever national social and behavioural insights study around vaccination. Bolsewicz presented the early findings from the survey at a NCIRS webinar on Thursday, and a separate presentation based on data from the Australian Immunisation Register showed thesteady decline in childhood immunisation coverage since the start of the pandemichas continued into mid-2024. Only 90.8% of two-year-olds were fully vaccinated in 2023, a fall from 92.1% in 2020, while only 93.3% of five-years-old in 2023 were fully vaccinated compared with 94.8% in 2020, according to associate professor Frank Beard from the NCIRS. While much of the media attention and popular perception around lagging vaccination rates has focused on vaccine hesitancy and concern, Bolsewicz said “the survey shows those practical barriers are really pronounced”. Of the respondents, 11% said they could not afford the vaccinations, 9.3% found it was not easy to get to an appointment, 8.2% did not prioritise vaccination appointments, while 6% did not not believe vaccines were safe and 5.3% did not believe vaccines were effective. “Even though childhood vaccination under the national immunisation program is supposed to be free of charge, there are other costs,” Bolsewicz said. “If you get a consultation at the same time some GPs will charge a co-payment, or costs associated with taking time off work for parents who are single parents, or the costs related to transport, especially for people living in regional and rural areas.” The survey results, which were weighted for state, regionality and age group, reflected vaccine uptake that was largely representative of current national childhood immunisation rates with 93.5% of respondents saying their children were up to date with their vaccinations, 4.85% partially vaccinated and 1.65% unvaccinated. “This is pretty spot-on nationally,” Prof Margie Danchin, another lead investigator of the project and a paediatrician at the Royal Children’s hospital in Melbourne, said. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The most common barrier parents reported in the survey was 60% said they felt distressed about vaccinating their child and the needle pain. Although people cited fear of needles, the barriers that were most associated with partial vaccination rates compared with the fully vaccinated group were practical access barriers – including affording, prioritising and getting to appointments – were most strongly linked. The barriers were higher among parents who also reported financial stress, Danchin said. The project will involve further research interviewing participants to understand more about the reasons why they could not afford costs or struggled to get to an appointment. Some of the barriers to parents getting to appointments include the inability to take young children under five to a pharmacy for their vaccinations, the lack of pop-up or weekend clinics and besides Victoria, very few free nurse-led immunisation clinics, Danchin said. Beard, who was not involved in the national vaccination insights project, said “regular monitoring of vaccination coverage is important, but it doesn’t tell us why childhood vaccination rates in Australia are declining. It is therefore critical to identify the barriers to vaccination uptake so that we can implement evidence-based approaches to address them”.",Natasha May
across-the-country,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/queensland-election-2024-lnp-abortion-policy-david-crisafulli,,Abortion wasn’t on the Queensland election agenda. So why is it now a threat to the LNP campaign? | Queensland election 2024 | The Guardian,,"On front doorsteps in Brisbane’s middle suburbs, Liberal National party candidates campaigning for the upcomingQueenslandelection have started getting questions about abortion. “It’s becoming an issue … in places we thought we might win,” says one party member.  Two weeks ago, as the Queensland election campaign began, Labor social media posts suggesting the LNP had a “secret plan” to limit abortion rights and access weredismissed as a scare campaign. The LNP leader,David Crisafulli, says his party has “ruled out” changes to Labor’s 2018 laws that decriminalised abortion. Abortion is, as Crisafulli says, “not a priority” for the LNP. But it has quickly become a problem. What might have started as a last-ditch Labor tactic has now become a mainstream issue, which LNP moderates say is damaging the party’s chances of regaining a footing in more progressive Brisbane electorates. This week the crossbench MP Robbie Katter pledged he would trigger a conscience vote to restrict – and possibly even criminalise – abortion. Crisafulli, whose ticket includes the former Christian right-backed senator Amanda Stoker and other MPs and candidates who are on record opposing abortion, has now been asked about the issue for five straight days. On Wednesday, he batted away 39 separate questions about the issue. Every question gets the same answer. The attempts to deflect are only adding fuel to the fire. Soon after Crisafulli became LNP leader in 2020, he struck a sort of informal stability deal with his party room to put internal fights to one side to bolster the LNP’s chances of taking back government. At the 2020 election, the LNP’s internecine bickering contributed to a weak result. Party members referred to unpopular office bearers – who tried to roll the leader, Deb Frecklington, just weeks before the campaign – as “the cabal”. The party’s identity crisis was writ large in an email from the then president, Cynthia Hardy, who said a review of the 2020 loss would seek to define what the LNP stood for. “What is our raison d’etre?” Hardy asked members. The four-year rebuild has now put the LNP in a position where, according to the polls, it is on the verge of winning government in Queensland. Sources say key to the success has been the informal stability arrangement – MPs from the moderates, conservatives and the Christian right all agreeing to drop their personal crusades and focus on a singular goal. The party found a unifying purpose: beating Labor. “But those divisions are still there, they haven’t gone away” one LNP source says. The shift in the campaign to focus on abortion rights, and the prospect of a conscience vote, serves to highlight those divisions in a way that can cause significant damage to the party, just weeks before voters go to the polls. The issue is so vexed for the LNP because it divides the party – the majority of its grassroots members, its platform and its MPs – from more progressive views of the electorate. Social reforms such as abortion and voluntary assisted dying have been key to Labor’s electoral success in Queensland, but particularly Brisbane where the LNP holds just four seats. Both of those reforms were progressed cautiously – drafted by the law reform commission and ultimately backed by polling that showed overwhelming support. And Labor has sought to exploit those sorts of social policy debates, knowing they harm the LNP in city areas where the party is eager to re-establish a presence. With the LNP cruising in the polls, moderates had held out hope of beating Labor in middle suburban seats – Ferny Grove, Stafford, Mansfield, Mount Ommaney and Aspley – areas beyond the reach of Greens insurgency, but still places where votes have more “small-l” liberal values. Many of these areas vote for the LNP at local and federal elections but are Labor strongholds in the state parliament. A Labor source says the reality is the state LNP is “way too wacko for Brisbane to stomach”. The added concern for LNP moderates is the potential makeup of the LNP party room after the election, if the party wins regional or city fringe seats but not Brisbane ones. “We need moderates in the next parliament,” one party member says. Party sources say the “Christian soldiers” grouping within the LNP has relatively little influence within the current state parliamentary team. There are really only two hardcore members of the Christian right in the LNP party room – the retiring rightwinger Mark Robinson and the veteran Sunshine Coast MP Fiona Simpson. Others often attributed as being associated with the faction, such as Tim Mander or Christian Rowan, are more neatly aligned with Peter Dutton’s mainstream conservative grouping. But before elections, factions always battle for influence. Robinson is handing his seat to Stoker, the former federal senator and figurehead of the Christian right. Candidates who have won preselection for winnable LNP seats include several who have ahistory of opposing abortion rights, or with links to Pentecostal churches. Particularly concerning to LNP moderates is the recent takeover of a large inner-city party division – and the attempted takeover of another – by the Christian right. The party’s Griffith federal divisional council – covering Queensland’s most progressive federal seat – is now helmed by Alan Baker, a veteran of anti-abortion campaigns in the state. Baker sent apre-election email on party letterheadsaying the government had been “captured by transgender ideology”. “Fringe infiltrators can see an election victory around the corner and are desperate to increase their influence,” an LNP source said at the time Baker won control of the branch. With polls still pointing to a comfortable LNP win, the risk for Crisafulli is that the prospect of a conscience vote – brought about by Katter – serves to highlight internal conflicts that have been paused, rather than solved. The opposition leader won’t say publicly whether he would allow a conscience vote, in line with party convention. The federal MP Colin Boycesaid it would be “extraordinary”not to. Crisafulli’s backers are mostly moderates, and MPs say the opposition has been “remarkably united” during the past term. But they also acknowledge that concern about abortion springs from “legitimate concern about what happens when we get in”. “It’s also difficult because we don’t have a track record to point back to,” the MP says. “We obviously try not to hark back to the Newman years.” In more than three decades, the conservatives have only won one Queensland election. After 2012, the landslide win by Campbell Newman, the LNP quickly became unstuck by factional warfare. The party’s MPs went to war with its organisational wing. The nature of the 2012 landslide also meant the election of new MPs who the party might not have expected to win. A state that voted for Newman, framed as a more moderate Liberal, wound up with a party room that veered more conservative and pushed that agenda in government. Griffith University political scientist and commentator Paul Williams says he expects those sorts of internal issues to come to the fore within 12 months of an LNP election win. “Those things are still there in the background,” he said. LNP figurespredicted Labor attacks about abortionwhen Stoker – who lost her Senate seat in 2022 – was preselected to run in Oodgeroo. Stoker announced herself to the public with a firebrand speech on the Senate floor, describing Queensland’s abortion decriminalisation laws as “barbarism [with] the cloak of civility”. In 2022, she told the Conservative Political Action Conference the Coalition would bein opposition for a “very long time”if it did not focus on conservative social issues. But since being announced as a candidate, Stoker has been uncharacteristically quiet as the LNP attempts to stifle intensifying debate about abortion and other social issues, and instead focus on kitchen-table ones. Her appearances on Sky News and rightwing podcasts and anti-abortion rallies have all been replaced with community breakfasts and visits to small businesses. Asked on Thursday whether she would support changes to Labor’s 2018 abortion laws, Stoker used the party line: “It’s not part of our plan, the LNP has ruled it out.” The LNP’s continued refusal to engage beyond its rehearsed line – that abortion reform is “not part of our plan” – now risks backfiring amid ramping pressure from different sides of the debate. At a pre-election meeting of a conservative Christian group last month, attenders were urged to email, call or speak to candidates and “just ask them the question: how would you vote if abortion came up”. “The fact you say that puts it in their mind that abortion is an election issue,” the forum moderator said. The LNP has not responded to the Australian Christian Lobby’s pre-election survey, which includes questions about abortion. The pro-choice service Children by Choice also sent questions to every state MP asking whether they supported, and would protect, ongoing access to termination of pregnancy.  have responded. “It feels ominous, it’s a scary position,” says Jill McKay, the chief executive officer of Children by Choice. “It’s a very simple question. “We’re not trying to polarise who people vote for, but it is a very deep concern that one of our major political parties is unable to present to Queensland what their policies are. “Women who vote for the LNP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the ALP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the Greens need to access abortion.” LNP sources acknowledge that the Katter plan to bring the issue to the next parliament “fucks us”. “[Crisafulli] needs to come out and say something more definitive,” one party source says. But another warns that sticking to the agreed lines remains the only tactic that could keep the informal stability arrangement in place. “The discipline that this whole campaign has been built on would dissolve in a second,” the source says.",Ben Smee
across-the-country,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/12/accc-suing-coles-woolworths-pricing-strategies-allegations,,From drip pricing to countdown clocks: five ways Australians can be duped into paying more | Business | The Guardian,,"The consumer watchdog issuing Coles and Woolworthsover allegations the major supermarkets misled customers by offering “illusory” discounts. While those claims are set to be tested in court, there are a slew of other practices retailers and service providers use to take advantage of shoppers, many of which don’t get caught by current consumer protections.  Consumer advocates say Australia’s laws lag the US, UK and EU when it comes to unfair trade practices, which means shoppers have to be alert. Here are five practices to look out for. It’s the online equivalent of “do you want fries with that”? During an online purchase, retailers now regularly suggest extra products to complement a purchase. The sophistication of those systems is improving, with online furniture stores among those now using artificial intelligence to suggest add-ons that will tempt shoppers. Consumer advocates say automated add-ons – where items are added at checkout without a customer’s express consent, such as extended warranties on appliances or expedited delivery programs – cross the line. “That type of thing is quite underhanded and can catch people out,” says Choice’s deputy director of campaigns, Andy Kelly. “Extended warranties don’t provide much more than what the law already provides for anyway so you could be paying for something that you are not going to get a whole lot of value from.” There have also been examples of add-ons that are designed to give consumers the impression they are getting a good deal that have resulted in prosecutions. Last year, Dell Australia was fined for making misleading representations about discounted prices for monitors that could be “bundled” with a computer purchase at the checkout. More than 5,300 monitors were sold to consumers with overstated discounts, which the company had to remedy after conceding it had misled customers. Many consumers have experienced the grim feeling of having a payment come out of their bank account for a subscription service they no longer use. According to Erin Turner, the chief executive of the Consumer Policy Research Centre, it’s good practice for companies to let subscribers know when a fee is about to be charged, along with instructions on how to cancel. “That’s what a respectful relationship looks like with your customers,” Turner says. “It’s not hoping that people don’t remember that you’re giving them a service. That is not a good business model.” Subscription traps are high on the list of consumer grievances, and the method of signing customers up to them can be murky. Some retailers add “free” subscriptions to an online basket, with auto-renew fees turned on, which can come back to haunt the consumer later on. Others make it tricky to cancel. Home improvement platform hipages, which connects trades people with customers, conceded last year it did not adequately disclose contract terms that allowed it to automatically renew subscriptions and charge an early termination fee for those looking to cancel. Some retailers and accommodation providers pressure shoppers into making premature buying decisions by using countdown clocks or notifications that other people are looking at an item the customer has their eye on. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion In reality, there’s a good chance another countdown sale is happening soon, and there’s probably plenty of that product or service to go around. “There’s a lot of dark patterns, manipulative design techniques used to create false urgency or scarcity,” Turner says. “They’re all designed to create this sense that you’re going to lose out if you don’t purchase quickly.” The usual test of authenticity is whether the sales tactic is alerting customers to a genuine offer or insight into selling conditions, or whether it’s just being used to create artificial time pressure. “Drip pricing” refers to extra fees and charges added during an online purchase that makes the cost much higher than the initial advertised price. This has traditionally been used in travel, food delivery, accommodation and ticketing industries and varies from annoying to misleading and illegal. It is such a big issue in the US, which refers to the additional costs as “junk fees”, that itprompted the White Houseto recently describe the charges as a means to “obscure true prices and dilute the forces of market competition that are the bedrock of the US economy”. Kelly says companies need to be upfront about the fees they are charging. “If they’re not telling you that there’s a booking fee at any point until you get to the very end, then it’s probably not OK,” he says. “You can get a shock right before you’re about to make your purchase, but there’s a danger you just go through with it because you’ve already spent so much time getting to that point.” If you’ve returned an item because you’ve changed your mind, a store credit might be an appropriate goodwill gesture by the retailer. But if there’s a significant problem with the product or service, customers should ask for their money back, Turner says. “If something’s gone wrong, if you didn’t get what you paid for, if it’s broken, if it doesn’t do what it’s meant to do, you should be able to get your money back – not a gift card, not a credit, not a promise,” Turner says. Qantas washeavily criticisedfor its use of Covid credits dating from the extensive cancellations and border closures that came during the early pandemic. After intense political and public scrutiny, it changed its policies to remove expiry dates on the use of credits and started offering customers refunds. Some companies prefer to give credits and gift cards rather than a refund because they know some consumers won’t get around to using them, while others will use them as part of a bigger purchase. “Quite often the first thing you’re offered won’t be what you’re owed under the law,” Turner says. “And it’s on you to then go back and say, ‘no, I want a refund’.”",Jonathan Barrett

Most lack insulation and guttering. At Drive-in Camp outside town, the homes are tin sheds, disconnected from services since the 2007 intervention but still occupied. The poor housing is making the residents sick, Jupurrurla says: “I worry about the future – will my grandchildren and their kids be living in prison-like houses? Or are we going to start designing homes that allow us to practise our culture?”  A $1bn investment in remote housing in the NT since 2017 has failed to solve the problem. A further $4bn was pledged in March in a joint announcement by the federal and territory governments. But health experts warn unless authorities commit to a dramatic shift in the way housing is designed and built for Indigenous communities, public health outcomes could worsen. Poor housing has been blamed for high rates of rheumatic heart disease in the NT. The preventable condition is caused by repeated, untreated streptococcus A infections and is linked to poverty, overcrowded and inadequate housing and lack of access to healthcare. Australia has one of the highest rates of RHD in the world, and rates have doubled between 2012 and 2021. Jupurrurla says community participation in decision-making leads to better maintenance and a sense of ownership. He is the chair of Wilya Janta, a cultural consultancy and housing collective based in Tennant Creek which has developed housing designs by Aboriginal people for Aboriginal people. “For too long, we’ve been given houses we had no say in designing,” he says. Simon Quilty, a GP based in Tennant Creek, also works with Wilya Janta. He says nothing symbolises the failure of government housing design more clearly than steel trapdoors. These were introduced about five years ago to accommodate future air conditioning installations. But instead of providing relief from the heat they act as conductors, turning homes into ovens. “If you can’t afford an aircon, then you’ll have a heat-conducting steel plate making you need that aircon even more than if you did have the money to buy one,” Quilty says. “It is madness, these design lunacies make houses more expensive to build and injure the wellbeing of the resident for no possible gain, to save a few measly bucks.” Glenn Platt, the executive director of strategy and innovation at Emergent Group, says the metal trapdoor is like “having an extra glass window in the room”. The result is a home which is hotter inside than out, a significant health risk when temperatures are frequently above 40C. Overcrowded and poorly ventilated housing is a major driver of preventable diseases among Aboriginal communities, with more than half of all Indigenous people in the NT living in overcrowded homes. Dr John Paterson, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT, says poor housing contributes to the spread of infectious diseases, hampers early childhood development, affects mental health, and diminishes social and emotional wellbeing. “Diseases like rheumatic heart disease are better termed diseases of poverty; driven by overcrowded housing, lack of access to washing facilities and palatable drinking water that is unfortunately too common in remote communities, particularly in the central region,” he says. Overcrowded environments increase the chances of repeated exposure to streptococcus bacteria. While harmless on the skin’s surface or easily managed by antibiotics in communities with good access to health services, repeat infections can lead to immune reactions that scar heart valves. “We’re asking for the same basic human rights which include the same building standards, the same building repair and maintenance expectations, the same basic functions of a house – like access to suitable drinking water and a continuous power supply – that people living in any other jurisdiction in Australia take for granted,” Paterson says. “But for too long these standards have not been met in remote communities.” Most government-built homes in remote areas are built using concrete blocks. They have inadequate thermal efficiency, poor ventilation and minimal climate control. The new housing funding will pay for up to 2,700 new three-bedroom homes over 10 years. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese,said the program was designed to halve overcrowding in Indigenous communities in the NTas part of the Closing the Gap goals. Some 971 new or replacement homes have been built and 489 expanded under other funding deals since 2017. A federal Department ofHousingspokesperson said the new builds would be constructed after consultation with Indigenous communities and Aboriginal Housing NT. Skye Thompson, AHNT’s chief executive, told Guardian Australia the new homes must be appropriate for the climate and culture of those living in them. “When houses are built to a lower standard of energy efficiency and works are not subject to a proper certification process; when they are poorly oriented, too hot or stuffy; and when the design doesn’t suit the residents’ family configuration or culture, the return on investment nosedives,” she says. The NT minister for housing construction, Bill Yan, said the new Country Liberal party government, whichswept to victory in Auguston a platform that included reversing youth justice reforms andlowering the age of criminal responsibility to 10, reaffirmed the NT government’s commitment to the $4bn housing partnership with the federal government. “The partnership with the federal government is a signed agreement that the new government will honour,” he said. “Territorians living in safe housing is an important part to community safety as well as enjoying our Territory lifestyle. “We will listen to stakeholders and communities on their housing needs and consider expert advice on any issues prohibiting effective and efficient delivery of remote housing.”",Otis Filley

The environment minister made a partial declaration under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act in August, blocking a proposal by mining company Regis Resources to build a tailings dam for its $900m McPhillamys gold project in the headwaters of the Belubula River. The declaration did not cover the rest of the proposed mining area.  Regis said at the time that the decision “made the project in its current form unviable”. In a 22-page statement on Friday, Plibersek said she noted that Regis had considered 30 alternative sites for a tailings dam, but recognised that the protection order would make the mine “unviable in the state in which it is currently proposed and approved”. “However, having considered all the submissions and material available to me in relation to the proprietary and pecuniary impacts of the making of a declaration over the specified area, I was satisfied that the proprietary and pecuniary impacts to the proponent and others do not outweigh the irreversible damage and permanent loss to the Aboriginal cultural heritage in the declared area,” she wrote. “The long-term effect on cultural heritage is permanent, and the loss of cultural heritage cannot be mitigated or reversed.” Regis Resources declined to comment further on Friday. The cultural heritage protection was welcomed by some traditional owners, locals and farmers. However, it was criticised by the mining industry, business groups and the mayor of the local council, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton,said he would overturn itif the Coalition won government next year. The decision was also criticised by theNew South WalesAboriginal Land Council (NSWALC), which said it was concerned that Aboriginal cultural heritage had been used “as a pawn for political posturing and advantage”. NSWALC represents the Orange Local Aboriginal Land Council (OLALC). The section 10 application was made by Wiradyuri elder Aunty Nyree Reynolds, who is represented by the Bathurst-based Wiradyuri Traditional Owners Central West Aboriginal Corporation (WTOCWAC). Both groups represent Wiradyuri peoples. Plibersek found that the Belubula River, headwaters and springs were “of particular significance to Wiradjuri people” and that the proposed construction of the tailings dam, which would involve plugging the springs with concrete, was “inconsistent with the treatment of waterways within Aboriginal tradition and pose a threat of injury or desecration to the area”. “Irreversible damage to the Belubula River headwaters would remain, despite proposed restoration of the mine site,” she said. Plibersek said even Regis’s conceptual drawings of the area post-rehabilitation showed the river to be “significantly modified”. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “Development of the [tailings storage facility] would involve plugging the springs with cement and the TSF may cause water pollution, which would not only threaten water quality in the Lachlan-Murray basin, but will sever Wiradjuri connection to the specific area,” she said. She also found that state heritage laws would not offer sufficient protection, citing a letter from the NSW environment minister, Penny Sharpe, who said intangible cultural heritage values were “not currently protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 unless an Aboriginal place is gazetted”, which this proposed site was not. Those laws also do not apply to approved state significant developments. The basis of the protection declaration was a claim that the Belubula River, headwaters and springs were the site of pre-initiation ceremonies in Wiradyuri culture and that the river itself was the subject of the Blue Banded Bee dreaming. Another area, the Dungeon Burial site, was found to be a significant Aboriginal site but not at risk from the proposed mine. The OLALC said it had no evidence or knowledge of the use of the area for ceremonial purposes. It also provided a statement from six people, including five Wiradyuri people, disputing the existence of any dreaming or creation story relating to the Blue Banded Bee. But Plibersek said WTOCWAC was “an established group of accepted community elders” and she was “satisfied that WTOCWAC had demonstrated that the individuals who provided the statements hold knowledge of traditions, customs and beliefs relating to the specified area”. She cited Dinawan Dyirribang Uncle Bill Allen, a senior Wiradyuri elder and descendent of the Wiradyuri warrior Windradyne, who said the area was “like a big university for our young fellas to come to get their learning”. She wrote that she understood that both the OLALC and Regis disputed that the area was used for ceremonial purposes but said she was “satisfied that this lack of knowledge is consistent with Aboriginal tradition that not all people are aware of the location of such ceremonies, particularly where those ceremonies pertain to men’s or women’s business”. On the Blue Banded Bee dreaming, she said OLALC’s comments were “consistent with WTOCWAC’s submission that the dreaming is knowledge that is only passed to specific custodians in accordance with Aboriginal oral tradition”. She added that the elder responsible for the story was in hospital at the time the initial section 10 report was compiled.",Calla Wahlquist
the-rural-network,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2024/oct/07/australia-regional-towns-treechange-best,,"Good coffee, breweries and dog washes: what makes a regional Australian town attractive to treechangers? | Gabrielle Chan | The Guardian",,"There’s a pub near me in a town of a few hundred people. The building was more than a century old, the verandas were sagging and the patrons were sparse. Two women saw its potential and took the surrounding country residents seriously enough to offer a good dining experience for a handsome price, confident we would pay for a decent meal in a beautifully restored building. It worked.  Every town has a similar story. The pub restoration didn’t happen in a vacuum. It was next door to a great cafe that already drew people in, as well as a greengrocer and a wine shop. With the pub, critical mass was bedded down in a village of 300. Together, these businesses create a gentrified precinct. You might know similar places, little pockets of caffeine-charged retail energy, that change the spending habits of locals and attract newcomers, some of whom move to the district permanently on the strength of the introduction. It is hard to nail down what constitutes gentrification. Certainly, fancy pubs and strong coffee are staple businesses. More than half of Australia’scraft breweriesand distilleries are now in regional Australia. Dog groomers may be associated with pampered inner-city pooches but they’re a dime a dozen in most country towns now. While those local businesses are responding to the demands of existing residents, they have become important markers for the kind of towns that have attracted treechangers. Surveying the regional landscape since the great regional migration in the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s not too much of a stretch to declare the country has developed its own kind of cool. Over the past year, two studies (bythe Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (Ahuri)andthe iMOVE Cooperative Research Centre) reveal that it was important to a portion of treechangers that their new community have an urban feel. Also important was proximity to the coast, a larger population centre and, most importantly, a job. The independent economist Kim Houghton said the recent research showed that while regional migration trends were changing, 73% of people in capital city households remained interested in moving to a regional city, compared to just 57% of people in regional households being interested in moving to a capital city. It’s the urban nature of a place like Ballarat in central Victoria that is an important attractor for people who cannot afford to live closer to the action in Melbourne. A bit of Brunswick in Ballarat, if you like. Treechangers often came to regional cities via the stepping stones of brand new suburban developments in places like Hume or Whittlesea that are a long way from an inner-city vibe, but don’t feel too different to the outer suburbs. “Ballarat has a gin distillery right in the middle of town so if that’s your jam, you could be within 10 minutes walk of it if you chose to,” Houghton said. So four years after the start of the pandemic, the great regional migration is morphing again. People are more strategic about their desires and if they move to a place that doesn’t quite provide the services they need, they are not afraid to move on again. Work arrangements remain the key to whether treechangers pick a city or country address. Sign up toThe Rural Network Subscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairs after newsletter promotion The data shows a very simple equation. If people have to go in to work every day, they prefer a regional city. If they have a hybrid office/home arrangement, they prefer a capital city. But if they can be fully remote, they again prefer a regional city. But the hype about the work-from-home trend as a regional winner has not been fully realised. Considercompanies such as Amazonwhich are trying to draw their workers back to the office, at the very least on a hybrid model. Some of the most critical jobs on the ground in regional places are those that require workers to show up every day, such as childcare, healthcare and education. So that preference for living and working in a regional city if you have to make a daily commute might bode well for regional communities. Finally, there was an idea that people would see the folly of their ways and, faced with lack of services and distance, would relocate back to a capital city. That is not borne out by the data. It is true to say, just because a place has attracted new residents, it doesn’t mean it will keep them. For example, the Ahuri research found that the likelihood of population churn was high across its case study areas of Port Macquarie, Ballarat and Broken Hill, with the highest number of survey respondents (44%) stating they were likely to move away in the next five years in Broken Hill. But it is more likely they will move to another regional place, rather than back to the city. Survey respondents stated they would most likely move to other regional cities (46%) rather than capital cities (30%) if they were to move away from the case study areas, which is still counter to the overall urbanisation trend in Australia. After years of trying to attract population, the biggest issue for local regional policymakers and planners is now anticipating population growth and the services, such as childcare, medical services and schools, needed to keep those new residents. Small places will rise and fall but regional cities, especially coastal ones, will continue to grow if they have the conditions right. It would seem the regional renaissance is not over.",Gabrielle Chan
the-rural-network,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/08/giant-red-tractor-carnamah-wa-australias-big-things,,‘Where’d you find tyres that size?’ Giant red tractor is Australia’s newest Big Thing | Western Australia | The Guardian,,"On the flat plains of midwestWestern Australia, three hours north of Perth, there is a new marker on the horizon. A red tractor, standing 11.5 metres tall and 16 metres long, dominates the skyline of the small town of Carnamah. The tractor is an exact replica of a Chamberlain 40K, built to five times the scale. It is the world’s biggest tractor statue, and the latest addition to Australia’scatalogue of Big Things.  The tractor was unveiled to a crowd of more than 2,000 people on Saturday. The tyres posed the biggest challenge in construction, says the retired farmer Bob Lukins, one of the men who spearheaded the project. They’re 7.8 metres in diameter, larger than the biggest commercially available tyres. “When people saw it they said, ‘where’d you find tyres that size?’ Because they look like tyres, until you tap them,” Lukins says. “They are not tyres, they are fabricated steel.” Lukins is one of the founding members of the WA Vintage Tractor and Machinery Association, or Tracmach, which was formed in 1981 and now has 600 members. In 1986, he says, they started talking about the idea of building a giant tractor somewhere in the WA wheatbelt, to showcase the state’s agricultural history and act as an advertisement for Tracmach’s machinery field days. But they never had the money or the government buy-in. Six years ago, they connected with a retired machinery dealer in Carnamah who put them in contact with the Carnamah historical society. The local shire got on board, but the project still didn’t have any money. “We applied for every grant there was,” Lukins says. “We got every one knocked back.” Eventually they connected with Frank Kidman, an engineer who agreed to waive the $20,000 design fee in lieu of the big tractor committee buying him the technical equipment needed to draw up the plans. “We got a Chamberlain 40K and we put it outside his back door, right off his deck,” Lukins says. “He measured every single part on that tractor, put it in the computer and five-timesed it. It took him more than 400 hours.” The Chamberlain 40K was chosen for its importance to WA agriculture. The machines were designed by the Victorian tractor mechanic Bob Chamberlain, who designed the prototype in the 1930s specifically for large landholdings like those in the expanding wheatbelt, midwest and Esperance cropping regions of WA. The tractors were manufactured in an ex-munitions factory in the Perth suburb of Welshpool and the first Chamberlain 40Ks rolled off the line in 1949. At 40 horsepower and weighing one tonne, the tractors were bigger and more suited to WA conditions than other tractors on the market at that time. In commemorating the tractor, Lukins says they are also honouring the work done by “our fathers, grandfathers, and their wives” in establishing the farming region. “The sheer hard work that those men and women did in those early days, firstly with horses and then with those early tractors, helped to get us to the stage that we are now where we all have a very high standard of living. And it’s now a little bit forgotten,” he says. The statue was constructed piece by piece by the mining contractor DIAB Engineering, in the nearby town of Geraldton. Sixty people worked on it over 17 months. It was delivered to Carnamah on six prime mover trucks and assembled, with final paint touch-ups, over the course of a week. The entire project has been funded through community fundraising efforts. Led by Tracmach’s president, John Piavanni, and Brendan Haeusler from the Big Tractor Project, the fundraising has netted $600,000 in private and corporate donations and some regional development grants, but the total cost for the project is $750,000. “We have not finished paying for it yet. We still have to raise a bit more money,” Lukins says. “But it’s a huge achievement for the Tracmach organisation. It puts WA and Australia on the map.”",Calla Wahlquist

Gelvana Aparecida Rodrigues da Silva, 37, lost her son Thiago on 5 November 2015 when the Fundão dam, near Mariana in eastern Brazil, collapsed,releasing about 50m cubic metres of toxic waste.  The avalanche of water reached the small community of Bento Rodrigues within minutes, killing 19 people, including Thiago, who had been staying with his grandmother at the time. “His grandmother said that he asked for Jesus,” said Da Silva of her son’s final moments. “He called for Jesus to save him. But they got ripped apart.” Thiago’s body was found a week later, 60 miles (100km) away. “That moment, my life ended,” she said. “Everything changed.” The iron ore waste stored in the dam rapidly moved down various watercourses, spilling over their banks and into the neighbouring municipalities of Mariana, Barra Longa, Rio Doce and Santa Cruz do Escalvado. Itdestroyed bridges, roads, houses, factories and other commercial premises, as well as farmland, wildlife and historic churches containing priceless artefacts. About 620,000 individuals, 46 Brazilian municipalities, 2,000 businesses and 65 faith-based institutions are to claim damages from the Anglo-Australian mining company BHP at a high court trial in London scheduled to be heard over 12 weeks, from 21 October. Tom Goodhead, the chief executive of the international law firm Pogust Goodhead, which is representing the claimants, said they will argue thatBHPis liable as a 50% shareholder in Samarco, the joint venture company responsible for managing the Fundão tailings dam. The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion It is further claimed that BHP, who were in a joint venture with the Brazilian iron-ore mining company Vale, were negligent in that although “they wereaware of the risks of the dam collapsing, they funded its expansion”, Goodhead said. The claimants are seeking up to $44bn (£33.6bn) in compensation. BHP, along with Vale and Samarco, established theRenova Foundationto provide compensation for individuals and some small businesses for loss and damages, as well as mitigating environmental impacts. The company said it would defend the legal action. A BHP spokesperson said: “The Fundão dam collapse was a tragedy and our deepest sympathies remain with the impacted families and communities. “The Renova Foundation, established in 2016 as part of our agreement with the Brazilian authorities, has spent more than $7.7bn on emergency financial assistance, compensation and repair and rebuilding of environment and infrastructure to approximately 430,000 individuals, local businesses and Indigenous communities. “BHP Brasil is working collectively with the Brazilian authorities and others to seek solutions to finalise a fair and comprehensive compensation and rehabilitation process that would keep funds in Brazil for the Brazilian people and environment affected, including impacted Indigenous communities. “BHP continues to defend the legal action in the UK. We believe that the UK litigation, which, if successful, would not see claimants receive payment until 2028 at the earliest, duplicates – and harms – local remedial efforts in Brazil. “As a non-operating joint-venture partner in Samarco, BHP Brasil does not have operational or day-to-day control of the business. BHP did not own or operate the dam or any related facilities.” Thiago’s father, who died two years ago, received a small payment for compensation after the disaster, which he shared with Da Silva, but she said she had not had any personal contact with the companies involved. She said: “The only thing that we are asking for is justice, for this to never happen to any other mother. No money in the world can bring my son back, but I want them to be responsible for this, for this crime.” Goodhead said: “To our knowledge, this is the largest ever group action in the English courts and we believe, probably the largest anywhere in the world. And that’s likely by value as well as the number of claimants who are participating in it.”",Daniel Boffey
around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/muslims-in-india-face-discrimination-after-restaurants-forced-to-display-workers-names,2024-10-13,Muslims in India face discrimination after restaurants forced to display workers’ names | India | The Guardian,,"Muslims inIndiasay they have been fired from their jobs and face the closure of their businesses after two states brought in a “discriminatory” policy making it mandatory for restaurants to publicly display the names of all their employees. The policy was first introduced by Yogi Adityanath, the hardline Hindu monk who is the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Last month the state of Himachal Pradesh, governed by the opposition Congress party, announced it would also make it compulsory for all names of workers and employees to be put on display.  Both state governments have said it is to ensure compliance with health and safety rules and vending regulations in the north Indian states. However, locals and activists have alleged that the new rules are instead a thinly veiled attack on Muslim workers and establishments. Names in India widely signify religion and caste and there are growing fears among Muslim business owners in Uttar Pradesh that this will lead to targeted attacks or economic boycotts, particularly by hardline Hindu groups that are active in the state. “This order is dangerous, it forces us to wear our religion on our sleeve,” said Tabish Aalam, 28, who comes from a long line of specialist chefs in the city of Lucknow. “I am sure the government knows this, and that is why it is being exploited.” Uttar Pradesh is governed by theHindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party(BJP) that also rules at the centre under the prime minister, Narendra Modi, whose decade in power has been marked bygrowing anti-Muslim discriminationand attacks. Adityanath is viewed as one of the most hardline leaders in the BJP. Since hebecame chief minister in 2017, he has introduced a flurry of policies that are accused of enabling the targeting of Muslims or fuelling anti-Muslim conspiracy theories. Business owners in Uttar Pradesh said they had fired Muslim staff as a result of the new laws, fearing they would become a target. Other Muslim-run businesses said they had already been harassed as a result of the policy, with some considering closure. Rafiq, 45, the Muslim owner of a highway restaurant in the Uttar Pradesh city of Muzaffarnagar, said he had fired his four Muslim employees in July after police demanded he put the names of all workers on a sign outside. “I had to fire my Muslim staff because I was concerned for their safety following the order,” he said. “Displaying names makes us vulnerable and a very easy target. If, for instance, there is communal tension that keeps taking place, we will be easily identified as Muslims and targeted.” Rafiq said he had little doubt as to why the Adityanath government was enforcing these new rules. “Displaying names will identify people’s religions, which I suspect is intended to discourage people from eating at Muslim-owned or Muslim-staffed restaurants,” he said. So far, Rafiq said, he had resisted police pressure to comply, but he said that if he was forced to, he would probably shut down his business altogether. Calls for economic boycotts of Muslims have been prominent in the state and there have been rising incidents of attacks against Muslim vendors over the past five years. Last month, the state leader of Bajrang Dal, a rightwing Hindu vigilante group, was captured on video at a meeting calling for attenders to pledge: “I will not buy goods from any Muslim shopkeeper.” Among the Muslims recently fired from a job as a cook was Idrees Ahmed, 31, who had held the position for seven years. He alleged he was among several Muslim members of staff let go as a result of the new policy. “The owner of the restaurant is a Hindu, and most of the other staff members were also Hindu,” Ahmed said. “When the order was issued, the owner called me and other Muslim staff members and apologised before asking us to go home.” Ahmed said he had been “emotionally shattered” by the ordeal and was struggling to support his family of five as no other restaurants would hire him. “I lost a job simply because of my religion,” he said. “I know so many Muslims who were working in different restaurants but were fired after the order.” In Muzaffarnagar, some alleged that only Muslim-owned businesses were being forced to comply. Mohammad Azeem, 42, who runs a small roadside stall, said he was the only business owner harassed by police to display his name on a sign. “The administration is deliberately trying to create a divide,” he said. “Why did they ask me selectively?” Praveen Garg, a BJP spokesperson in Uttar Pradesh, said the policy was to ensure restaurant hygiene, and he emphasised that “nobody is being denied permission to work”. “The government was obligated to take this action after becoming aware of situations in which food was purposefully contaminated,” Garg said. “There have been instances where persons from a specific community have been caught polluting meals with dirty items that a Hindu cannot consume.” Several incidents suggesting that vendors had mixed spit and urine with food and drink items recently went viral and led to arrests in the state. However, despite allegations by rightwing Hindu groups that there was a Muslim conspiracy to commit “spit jihad”, there was no evidence that the incidents were specifically targeted at Hindus. In July, India’s supreme court blocked a separate order by the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments – both BJP-ruled states – that had demanded restaurants along the route of an annual Hindu pilgrimage display the names of their owners and operators. A petition against the order brought by opposition politicians argued that it was “discriminatory on grounds of religion”. Despite the controversy and allegations of stirring up religious division, in September the state government of Himachal Pradesh said it would soon be following Uttar Pradesh’s example. It cited food hygiene as well as fears over an “influx of migrants” as the reasons behind bringing in the policy. Vikramaditya Singh, a Himachal Pradesh Congress leader and state minister, said the matter was still under deliberation. “There will be no compromise with the internal security of the state. The law is applicable for everybody. Why should one particular community feel threatened or have apprehensions?” said Singh. However, he added that if there were widespread concerns about the display of names “then some other way will be explored”. Business owners accused the local Congress party of going against its pledges of secularism and using the divisive policy to court the Hindu-majority vote in the state. Sharik Ali, 27, who runs a small restaurant in Shimla, in Himachal Pradesh, said: “I will not feel safe after displaying my name on my stall. We have seen how Muslims across India have been attacked in the last 10 years of Modi’s rule, but I was not expecting this from the Congress government. They know what will fetch them votes.”",Hannah Ellis-Petersen
around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/13/democrats-michigan-saginaw-kamala-harris,2024-10-13,Democrats on edge in critical Michigan amid fears of waning enthusiasm | US news | The Guardian,,"Donald Trump’s supporters do not pitch up at his rallies expecting to hear policy speeches or even the truth. Mostly they go for the comfort of distractions from hard realities and the allure of false promises to revive the past. But some of the loudest cheers at Trump’s recent rally in Saginaw, Michigan, came in response to a claim the former US president’s supporters could believe, when he said election polls were swinging his way in the battleground state and that Kamala Harris’s “honeymoon period” was over.  “We’re up in all of the polls. We’re up in every swing state. They had a honeymoon period,” he said before he was drowned out by the cheering crowd. With just three weeks left until the election, Democrats fear that Trump is right. Some complain that Harris has squandered an initial burst of enthusiasm after Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, which sparked a surge in fundraising and volunteering for her campaign. Michigan is one of the handful of key swing states that will decide the result of this most momentous of elections. While Harris has a slight lead in national polls, she isstruggling in Michigan, a state she must win or face a more challenging path through the US’s electoral college to take the White House. Trump won the state by just 10,704 in 2016 and lost it by a narrow margin to Biden four years later. The stakes are enormous. Trump has campaigned in 2024 on an ever more extreme platform, threatening mass deportations of immigrants and promising to seek revenge on his political enemies if he returns to the White House. Last week, Trump even demanded one of America’sbig television networks lose its licencebecause he sees its political coverage as unfair to him. In a country that prides itself on free speech, freedom of the press could ail quickly under a second Trump term. For many, US democracy itself feels on the line. The Harris campaign has long considered its easiest path to victory is by winning the Rust belt battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. If the vice-president were to lose in Michigan, she would almost certainly need to win one of the other closely contested states of Georgia, Arizona or North Carolina. AQuinnipiac University pollreleased last Wednesday put the vice-president three points behind Trump in Michigan, whilepoll trackersoffer a mixed picture. For those desperate to know which way Michigan might go, it is Saginaw that is thebellwether county of the state. Barack Obama won it twice before Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the county by a little more than 1,000 votes, just over 1% of the ballot, in 2016. Four years later, Biden took Saginaw county from Trump by an even narrower margin of just 303 votes. In what is expected to be a knife-edge US election decided by a few voters in a handful of key battleground states, the Guardian is exploring Saginaw, Michigan. It is a swing area in a swing state whose voters will bear an outsize influence on the outcome of the fight between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Chris McGreal is on the ground in Saginaw in the run up to November's election examining the issues that voters of all political backgrounds care about.  Saginaw voters: tell us which issues will decide the US election Both campaigns are piling resources into Michigan including a deluge of frantic television advertising, and a merry-go-round of candidates and prominent supporters wheeling through the state. Harris’s running mate, Tim Walz, was in Detroit on Friday looking to win over blue-collar union voters. The vice-president is expected in Detroiton Tuesdayin a bid to turn out Black voters who are key to a Democratic victory in Michigan. The Harris campaign has wheeled out Barack Obama in recent days and sent Bernie Sanders, the darling of the left of the Democratic party, to rally student support in Saginaw a week ago. Meanwhile Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, traversed Michigan promising to bring back the old and attacking the new. Vance joked to an audience in Detroit on Tuesday about the importance of the state: “I’m going to be in Michigan like 30 times” before the election. The pair have repeatedly pledged to make the American car industry great again, after so many jobs were lost to globalisation and automation, while attacking its future by scorning electric vehicles. Trump’s rally in Saginaw leaned heavily on promises to bring back the dozen or so auto factories in the county that have closed in recent years. Alongside the fantasy promises is a darker campaign aimed at those who do not fit the view of what many Trump supporters think an American should look like. Some of it is dressed up as opposition to illegal immigration but groups supporting Trump are running television ads with sinister overtones in Michigan, including one paid for by Duty to America that shows a series of photographs of white people who are said to have been “left behind”. “Even if we do everything right, Harris and the Democrats find new ways to make us pay. For what? No matter what we do, Democrats are against us. So this November, we’re against them,” it said. Across the key Rust belt states, Trump has a clear lead on two of the most important issues for many voters, the economy and immigration. He is even ahead by one point on which candidate would better preserve democracy, despite his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, according to theQuinnipiac poll. Behind the scenes, Democratic strategists are increasingly alarmed by the numbers. The party’s US Senate candidate in Michigan, Elissa Slotkin, warned last month that Harris was not polling as well as expected. “I’m not feeling my best right now about where we are on Kamala Harris in a place like Michigan,” shetold a fundraiser. “We have her underwater in our polling.” Some Democratic campaigners blame the campaign. Carly Hammond is an organiser for the US’s largest trade union confederation, the AFL-CIO, for the Saginaw region who is running for city council while also canvassing for Harris. “This is the most expensive election in American politics so far. There’s more money around, more ads, more signs, the volunteers are there. I really haven’t seen anything like this in terms of the mobilisation efforts,” she said. “What is missing is Harris’s policies. People ask: ‘What is she going to do?’ I’ve heard about 200 Harris ads in the past few weeks just because they’re inescapable. But I couldn’t tell you what her concrete plan is to tackle anything.” Some of the Democratic messaging in Michigan plays to Trump’s agenda, with repeated promises to “secure the border” even though Saginaw is 1,500 miles from the Mexican frontier and undocumented immigrants make up only about 1% of the state’s population. But it does not appear to be doing Harris much good while alienating some Democrats. Hammond said she feared that Harris had retreated into defensive messaging and a reliance on scaring voters over Trump’s ties to Project 2025, the authoritarian plan to impose rightwing control across the entire US government, that is costing her momentum. “When it switched over from Biden to Harris, there was an expectation that Harris would put out her own aggressive policy proposals and that hasn’t happened. There’s been a kind of walking back. Harris’s campaign said she’s going to take on the billionaires and corporate interest rates. A lot of that language fell off and now it’s just kind of ‘Project 2025, it really sucks’,” she said. Trump, on the other hand, has been hitting the state with hard promises even if they’re unlikely to be fulfilled. He told his audience in Saginaw he would make Michigan the “car capital of the world again” after General Motors closed a dozen factories in the county and moved some production to Mexico. Sign up toThe Stakes — US Election Edition The Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential election after newsletter promotion “Under my plan American workers will no longer be worried about losing their jobs to foreign nations. Instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America. We’re bringing them all back,” he said. Large numbers of Trump voters don’t believe it will happen, not least because he made the same promise in 2016 and the factories didn’t return. But they apparently don’t care. Gary Ell, chair of Saginaw’s Republican party and a fervent Trump backer, said his supporters take the promise alone as evidence that the former president cares about them while the Democrats care about other people. “They don’t look at him as being a politician. They still look at him as being an experienced former president who still stands on the same policies that he stood for before with the exception that the economy has gotten so much worse and the migration of mass illegal aliens has gotten so much worse. Those are two things that he had in check when he was president before,” he said. Biden boasts of a booming economy, including record job growth, but statistics mean little to large numbers of Americans who feel much worse off after years of surging inflation. Saginaw’s largest food bank has just received a $1m grant to expand because so many families are buckling under high grocery prices. Still, the Harris campaign has been encouraged bydatashowing the vice-president gaining ground with white voters without college degrees in Michigan, a key part of Trump’s base. In a move to shore that up, Democratic heavyweights from out of state, including the former US senator from Indiana Joe Donnelly, descended on Saginaw last Wednesday to tell trade union members that Biden had been good for blue collar workers and Harris would be too. The area’s member of Congress, Dan Kildee, warned the workers that Trump’s false promises could cost them their jobs. “This is a union hall where everybody’s working because the Biden-Harris administration has invested in American manufacturing. When Donald Trump was president, we were losing these jobs. Sixty per cent of these people were unemployed. Under Biden-Harris, they’re back to work. So, the question is, are we going to continue on this path or are we going to go back to those days?” he said. The Harris camp also brought Sanders to Saginaw to get outthe student votewith a rally at the local university. He said that Trump’s denial of the climate crisis threatened the future of the planet and warned that another Trump presidency could be a decisive blow to a democracy already undermined by a growing oligarchy. Sanders also mocked Trump for losing the support of his own vice-president, Mike Pence. “Mike Pence is a very conservative guy. His views are nothing like mine. I disagree with him on every issue. But he worked with Trump every single day and he said Trump is not fit to be president of the United States,” Sanders told a standing-room-only crowd. Some Michigan Republicans are pushing a similar message. A former member of Congress from Detroit, Dave Trott, and otheranti-Trump conservatives launchedMichigan Republicans for Harris-Walz earlier this month, aimed at the more than 350,000 Republicans in Michigan who voted against the former president in their party’s primary in February. Trott accused Trump of “gutting Michigan’s economy” and called him “more dangerous than ever”. It’s not clear if any of this is changing anyone’s vote. Both camps are focused on turnout, knowing that it is likely to decide the election. Trump’s support in Michigan went up in 2020 but he was beaten because many of those Democrats who stayed home when Clinton was the candidate four years earlier came out to remove him from the White House. Trump has been restating his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen in urging supporters to vote in order to make the election “too big to rig”. Harris is counting on the enthusiasm initially generated by her campaign, particularly among young female voters. Ultimately, the election in Michigan may be decided by events half a world away. More than 100,000 peoplevoted uncommittedin the state’s Democratic primaries in February in a protest against Biden’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza, as the Palestinian civilian death toll climbed into the tens of thousands. But the Uncommitted movement is now alarmed at the prospect of those supporters boycotting Harris if it delivers Michigan to Trump. On Tuesday, the group’s co-founder Lexi Zeidan pleaded ina videoon social media to not let that happen. “As a Palestinian American, the current administration’s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralising, but the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [the Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map,” she said. Zeidan’s warning fell well short of an endorsement of Harris but across Michigan, the vice-president’s campaign is counting on fear of Trump as much as enthusiasm for the vice-president to get her over the line.",Chris McGreal
around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/13/harris-trump-election-race-campaign,,"Harris and Trump, locked in tight race, seek edge among undecided voters | US elections 2024 | The Guardian",,"Kamala HarrisandDonald Trumpspent Sunday trying to shore up political support among what they perceived to be must-have voting blocs with polls showing them locked in a tight 5 November presidential race. With election day less than a month away, the Democratic vice-president attended a Black church in Greenville, North Carolina, as part of her campaign’s “souls to the polls” push. She then held a rally at East Carolina University, exalting the way communities – especially in the western part of the state – were coming together after damage from Hurricane Helene in late September, especially the way “people who have the least give the most”.  Her Republican opponent, meanwhile, was in Arizona – looking for Black and Latino support as he seeks a second presidency, after a rally in California a day earlier. Both candidates are attempting to get a decisive edge among votes who have not yet decided who to support. Surveys show that early voting, which tends to favor Democrats, is down 45% from previous election years – a sign that there may be millions of undecided voters. Trump has now switched from condemning early voting as a Democrat plot to engineer his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020 to urging people to vote early and by mail. A recent ABC News-Ipsospollshowed that support was split down gender lines, with women voting 60-40 to Harris and men breaking for Trump by a similar margin. Trump needs white women, who supported him in a greater numbers in 2020 than in 2016 – but also Black men. On Sunday, he argued that his fellow former president Barack Obama’s call last week for Black men to support Harris based “solely on her skin color, rather than her policies” as “deeply insulting”. Democratic Georgia senator Ralph Warnock on Sunday told CNN, “Black men are not going to vote forDonald Trumpin any significant numbers.” But his fellow Black Democrat Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina congressman, told CNN, “Yes, I am concerned,” about Black men voting for Trump. A New York Times poll publishedSunday found that Harris is underperforming the last three Democratic candidates for the White House among Latino voters. The election may come down to fractional increases in support for each.An NBC News pollreleased Sunday showed the candidates in a “dead heat” nationally at 48% support. The poll found that voters are reassessing Trump’s first term more favorably – but also that voters view reproductive rights as a top motivating issue, which could hurt the former president after three of his US supreme court appointees eliminated the federal right to abortion. A CBS News poll, also released Sunday, found that the presidential race is more than just two conflicting ideologies – but about a fundamental disconnection. For instance, most Trump supporters said relief for victims of Hurricanes Helene and Milton wasn’t reaching affected people – while Harris supporters indicated it was. Trump supporters said the economy was bad; Harris supporters said it was good. Trump’s voters said US-Mexico border crossings were increasing; Harris’s voters said they were down. Trump’s voters, especially the men, said gender equality efforts had gone too far; Harris voters said not far enough. But both agreed that social media was untrustworthy and had made it harder to find things to agree on and to tell fact from fiction. But the response to the two hurricanes that the south-eastern US recently continued to dominate Democrats’ campaign. On Sunday, Biden was scheduled to survey damage inflicted on Florida’s Gulf coast by Milton, where he would announce $600m in funding for damaged electrical grids. Response to hurricanes remains Democrats’ political preoccupation. Harris’s rally Sunday came amid the intense politicization of the speed of federal disaster response to Helene. At the rally, she appeared to be looking to defuse hurricane politics. Crises, she said, “have a way of revealing the heroes among us, the angels among us, and of showing us all the best of who we are ... heroes who do not ask the injured or stranded whether they are a Republican or a Democrat, but who simply ask: ‘Are you OK?’” Sign up toThe Stakes — US Election Edition The Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential election after newsletter promotion That came as theWall Street Journal reportedthat some of the earlier response to Helene had come in the form of Patriot Front, an organization that the Anti-Defamation League has concluded is a white-supremacist group – and that was using misinformation as a recruiting tool. With Arizona, Nevada and Georgia potentially leaning for Trump, and Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin potentially leaning for Harris, the loss of North Carolina would cost Trump 16 electoral college votes needed to reach the winning threshold of 270. The state narrowly voted for Trump in 2020. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday that he would deny Harris and Biden’s call to bring Congress back to Washington to approve more disaster relief funding after the hurricane. “It can wait,” Johnson said, pointing to $20bn in additional disaster funding that had recently been approved. He claimed only 2% of that funding had been distributed. As soon as states have assessed and calculate their “actual needs”, and submitted them, “Congress will meet and in bipartisan fashion, we will address those needs.” Johnson accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) of being “slow to respond”. He said: “They did not do the job that we all expect and hope that they will do, and there’s going to be a lot of assessment about that as well in the days ahead.” But with Harris’s support appearing to slip in recent weeks, including after a series of TV appearances, there are reports of growing tensions between her campaign and Biden’s White House. The president cancelled a trip to Germany to concentrate on the hurricane response. But he is nowreportedto have rescheduled the trip for Friday. According to Axios, Biden aides remain wounded by the president being pushed out of his re-election bid amid questions about his age. He is 81 – only three years older than Trump. Harris’s team believed Biden upstaged her by holding an impromptu press briefing while she held a rally in Michigan. Biden on Sunday was expected to meet with Florida governor Ron DeSantis, with whom Harris was feuding earlier in the week. An aide toHarris, 59, told the outlet that the president’s team are “too much in their feelings”.",Edward Helmore
around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/13/how-kamala-harris-win-in-us-election-could-depend-on-democrats-in-london,,How a Harris win in US election could depend on Democrats in London | Democrats | The Guardian,,"On a chilly afternoon in centralLondon, the battle for the US presidential election is being waged with no less fervour than if the campaigners were on the other side of the Atlantic. Surrounded by posters for the Democratic ticket of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, volunteers at an office organised by Democrats Abroad have been hitting the phones, calling Americans living abroad, including wavering Republicans, to urge them toregister to vote.  The event was just one that took place on a Day of Action at locations around the UK, estimated to be home to as many as 200,000 Americans. By evening, activists from chapters based in locations ranging from Scotland to English university cities were due to tune into a zoom rally addressed by Nancy Pelosi, former speaker of the House of Representatives. “Many of us have been living abroad for years, even decades, but we care deeply about what’s at stake back home and we also want it to be a place that we still recognise when we return, whether that’s a country where democracy has been preserved or even one that is still safe when it comes to the rights of women, our sisters and our daughters,” said Kristin Wolfe, Chair ofDemocratsAbroad UK and a resident in London since 2007. The potential role of overseas Americans voters – who do not appear in national polls – should not be underestimated. In 2020 their votes made all the difference when it came to delivering the keyswing statesof Arizona and Georgia to Joe Biden. With the race so tight and the stakes this high – Wolfe’s voice cracks as she insists that US democracy is imperilled in a way not seen since the American civil war – Harris supporters in the UK have raised their game. At bus shelters in parts of London with higher concentrations of Americans you’ll find adverts placed strategically by the group. For the first time too, digital advertising aimed at the community is being deployed on Google. There are also efforts to reach out and encourage voter registration face to face, such as at freshers’ fairs in Oxford. On other recent weekend afternoons, activists set up open-air tables in Hyde Park and at Marylebone Farmer’s Market in London to catch any passing Americans. Among curious passersby who stopped at the market table was the British pop star, Harry Styles, although the singer is not known to have a US passport. That said, Democrats in the UK have suddenly found a local celebrity of their own in the form of Matt Klaber, who was a student at the high school whereTim Walzonce taught and who recently spoke in London at a “re-watch” of the vice-presidential debate. Klaber – a London-based software engineer and Democratic activist – also played a role in Walz’s own political “origin story” when he took students to see a George W Bush campaign rally in 2004, only for some of them to be turned away by organisers who believed they were Democrats. The experience led Walz to seek public office. One of those students was Klaber, who insists that Walz’s wholesome public persona is exactly true to the one he and others have long known in person. “My earliest recollection of Tim is of being in the school library and seeing him rush out with his jacket and briefcase because he was being activated as a national guardsman who was going to help lead the response to some flooding,” he says. “The whole campaign metaphor of being a coach might have been a bit foreign to me as I wasn’t necessarily into sports, but actually they’ve nailed it. He is everybody’s coach, whether it’s what he was doing when he was a teacher, what he did in 2004 when there was the incident at the rally, or what he’s doing now by stepping up.” Efforts by Democrats Abroad UK to mobilise US voters in the UK and elsewhere are taking on a new urgency as registration deadlines loom for states including Wisconsin (16 October) and Pennsylvania (21 October). So too are efforts to counter misinformation in the form of misleading claims by Donald Trump that Democrats were somehow preparing to “cheat” and that ballots were being sent overseas without proper checks. “That’s just so blatantly false because the truth is that processes of the most rigorous kind are in place,” said Wolfe, who accuses Trump of seeking to intentionally confuse and mislead because he is concerned about the potential impact of overseas voters.",Ben Quinn
around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/13/trump-anti-immigrant-racism-hate-white-supremacy-springfield,,‘He gives them the green light’: Trump’s rhetoric revives hate groups across US | US elections 2024 | The Guardian,,"For Denise Williams, the 70-year-old head of Springfield’s NAACP chapter, the past several weeks have been testing to say the least. Last month,flyerscalling for mass deportations of immigrants were distributed by the so-called Trinity White Knights, a group associated with the Ku Klux Klan, in Black-majority neighborhoods in south Springfield.  “I’m telling people: do nothing – don’t approach them. But it’s not easy for people to see this,” she said. “I think that is what a lot of folks cannot understand – why do we have so much hate?” About 22% of Springfield residents are African American,according to the US Census Bureau. “People are mad. African Americans here don’t understand how this is allowed. We just have to take this for a minute. I know it’s hard.” Trinity White Knights is headquartered in Kentucky,whereflyers were also seen by residents of the Cincinnati suburb of Covington in July as part of an apparent recruitment effort. The flyers included a PO box address in Maysville, Kentucky, and a phone number. Ever since Donald Trump claimed during a 10 September televised debate watched by 67 million people that immigrants in Springfield were eating people’s pets – a claim that has beenfound to be baseless– Springfield has seen a groundswell in far-right extremism. On a recentweekend, several people affiliated with Blood Tribe, a neo-Nazi group founded in 2020, stood in front of the home of the mayor of Springfield holding flags bearing swastikas. The same weekend, individuals holding signs that said: “Haitians Have No Home Here” in English and Haitian Creole were seen outside Springfield’s city hall offices. And in another incident, a volunteer with the Clark county Democratic party was verbally threatened by a group of Proud Boys members last month,according to a reportby the Dayton Daily News. Proud Boys is a far-right group that,according to Reuters, has re-emerged in recent months as “unofficial protectors of ex-president Donald Trump”. That followed a group called the Israel United in Christ, ahate group as designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center, holding a large public gathering in south Springfield on 21 September. Though Israel United in Christ says it does not “advocate or condone any acts of violence against any race, ethnicity or gender”, the Anti-Defamation Leaguehas accused it of antisemitism. During the vice-presidential debate, the Republican party candidate, JD Vance,repeated the false claimthat Springfield’s Haitian community were “illegal immigrants”. The vast majority of Haitians in Springfield have legally entered the US through the temporary protected status program, a status that is provided to nationals of certain countries experiencing significant security challenges. “They feel emboldened by the former president. They feel like it’s OK to do this,” said Williams. “He gives them the green light. By him saying hateful things and falsehoods, they feel comfortable in speaking the way they are speaking [and] coming in here doing what they are doing.” But the rise in hate group activity in recent weeks hasn’t been confined to Springfield. In Charleroi, a town of about 4,000 people in western Pennsylvania, adigital flyer was this week distributedon Facebook by or on behalf of the Trinity White Knights. It read, in part: “Do not let the government destroy your town. These 3rd world immigrants are destroying every single city they arrive in. The government is pushing these 3rd world immigrants into every single town across America.” Joe Manning, the Charleroi town borough manager, said there were about 700 Haitian immigrants living in Charleroi, with many working at a local food processing plant. “They’ve been here for five, maybe six, years and nobody really paid attention to them,” he says. That was before 15 September, whenTrump said at a rallyin Tucson, Arizona, that Charleroi “isn’t so beautiful any more” and that the town had become “composed of lawless gangs”, comments aimed at the town’s growing immigrant population. “We’re a pretty small community here in western Pennsylvania, and to be identified by name [by Trump], that sort of set off this whole firestorm,” said Manning, who believed the appearance of the KKK-linked flyer after Trump’s comments wasn’t coincidental. “Before this, no one really paid attention to the immigrant community here but now, all of a sudden, it’s like, ‘Oh, my God, we’re being invaded.’ They say it’s a crisis. Well if it is, it’s the slowest goddamn crisis I ever saw.” In Wyoming, graffiti in clear view of a major interstate supportingPatriot Front, a white supremacist group,appeared on a bridge last week, while abanner promoting the same groupand calling for the “recaiming” (sic) of America was removed from a bridge in downtown Winston-Salem in North Carolina days after Trump’s debate comments. A student event held at the University of South Carolina featuring the founder of the Proud Boys, Gavin McInnes, on 18 September is believed to haveattracted about 150 attendees. “Springfield is not happening in isolation. We have tracked four other incidents, such as targeting the Haitian community in Alabama,” said Rachel Carroll Rivas of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks incidents of hate across the US. “We’ve also seen the sharing and pushing of the racist and antisemitic great replacement theory in various campaign and hate group messaging in the last few weeks.” For Williams, who finds herself managing growing community outrage at the rise in KKK and other hate group activity in Springfield, recent events have come at a personal cost. She said she had received text messages from someone claiming to represent Blood Tribe and had increased her security in recent weeks. Last weekend, when members of the same group appeared at the mayor of Springfield’s home, the chief of police sent a security detail to her home. “I’m looking over my shoulder,” she says. “You would think that this would be over – I don’t get it, in 2024.”",Stephen Starr

When they were displaced a second time, to the mountains around the capital by awave of Israeli attacks on southern Beirut,regular deliveries of meals, food parcels and even cleaning supplies from organisations connected to the group have kept them afloat. “They are taking incredible care of us even with everything that is happening. They never leave us alone,” said Hind Sabra, whose name has been changed. Their house of 14 people contains three families, each receiving a $200 (£150) monthly stipend in cash as well as cut-price medications, and food parcels containing rice, oil, tuna and beans.  The food, medication and cash are all part of a network of support long maintained byHezbollah, including a de facto bank that has flourished amid Lebanon’s years-long financial crisis, a fund that cares for the families of those killed in battle, and a social care organisation responsible for distributing cash payments to tens of thousands displaced earlier this year, according to a Hezbollah official. Over the past two decades, Hezbollah has come to dominate the various groups that make up Lebanon’s fractured and sectarian politics, as well as exerting control over key industries such as agriculture and construction in the south. Lina Khatib of Chatham House said the group’s status had grown to “influence and control the state inLebanonfrom within state institutions as well as outside them”. Western countries, including the US and UK, have placed sanctions on Hezbollah and regard it as a terrorist organisation. Meanwhile the group, which comprises a paramilitary organisation and a political party, maintains a support base mainly among Lebanon’s working-class Shia Muslim community that see Hezbollah as a defender of their interests, and essential protection against Israeli military power. Members of Lebanon’s Shia sect displaced in recent weeks by a dramatic escalation in Israeli bombardments across southern Lebanon said they are confident that Hezbollah will protect them as well as rebuild their homes and compensate them in future. But with more than a million people now displaced, according to the Lebanese government, few indications of an imminent ceasefire, and Israeli assassinations targeting Hezbollah’s leadership, the current escalation could test Hezbollah’s ability to support its base in the long term. Last week, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, gave a speech that called on the people of Lebanon to “stand up and take your country back” from Hezbollah, indicating a shift in Israel’s aims in Lebanon. Netanyahu suggested that Israel could now seek to change the country’s political leadership, rather than attacking Hezbollah’s presence in the south. “You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,” he said to the country, hinting at far broader aims that could spell greater destruction and a longer period of fighting. Sam Heller, an analyst with the thinktank Century International, said much depended on how far Israeli forces were able to advance in southern Lebanon, as well as Israeli leaders’ own clarity about their aims. If Israel reoccupies parts of southern Lebanon, making hundreds of thousands of people who make up Hezbollah’s support base homeless, “that is something that would inflict real suffering and I think likely weaken the organisation, and substantially complicate its ability to provide for the welfare of these people,” he said. Fighting betweenIsrael and Hezbollah in 2006 killed almost 1,200people in Lebanon and injured more than 4,400, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, a third of whom were children. About 900,000 people were displaced during the month-long war. Concerns that Israeli attacks could continue for far longer than the 2006 war, and do more damage, worry Mona Talib, a 42-year-old teacher who fled Dahiyeh for the safety of the mountains around Beirut and whose name has also been changed for her safety. But, she said, Lebanon’s Shia community have put their trust in Hezbollah and its record of reconstruction after the fighting ended in 2006, and cited what she termed her “deep faith” in the organisation’s eventual victory. “Even if I lose my house, I know it will be rebuilt. It might take a long time, but eventually it will happen,” she said. “People have great faith that their houses will be rebuilt again, whether in Beirut’s southern suburbs, south Lebanon or the Bekaa valley. People return to the past, they remember what happened to them, and they build their future on it.” Talib said she saw the experience of a close friend who lived in the heart of Dahiyeh, whose “whole building was destroyed” in the 2006 war. “They got their house back. I visited her in the old house, I saw the new one with my own eyes. I saw and know someone who lived it. Simple,” she said. Hachem Haidar, who heads the Lebanese government’s regional development agency known as the Council for South Lebanon, was less certain. Continued Israeli bombardments that have levelled towns near the de facto border with Israel had made it “difficult to determine the damage”, he said. As for whether Hezbollah would later compensate those who had lost their homes, as recently promised, he said “honestly, I don’t know”. Ahmad Noureddine, 26, whose name has also been changed, said he had stayed in a makeshift shelter run by Hezbollah for a few days, and that while it covered the essentials, such as food, water and medicine, the place had been overcrowded and it had made for an experience unpleasant enough that he moved elsewhere. Like Talib, Noureddine currently owes money to Qard al-Hasan, a microfinance institution and de facto bank placed under sanction by the US treasury in 2007 for its ties to Hezbollah. after newsletter promotion In sanctioning seven of Hezbollah’s “shadow bankers” in 2021, the treasury said Qard al-Hasan “masquerades as a non-governmental organisation”, while providing banking services that support Hezbollah and evade regulations, and “hoarding hard currency that is desperately needed by the Lebanese economy”. Noureddine said he was unconcerned by the required repayments for his $6,000 loan from Qard al-Hasan, namely that it might start asking for repayment during wartime. “They can be flexible with payments,” he said. “They’re very honest, and they fear God. They don’t take interest.” Talib, who took out a $3,000 loan, remains confident that Qard al-Hasan will not ask for repayments until the fighting ends, citing people she knows who received the cash value of their gold deposits destroyed in airstrikes two decades ago. “People trust this institution. Trust is even more important than protection,” she said, adding that she was doubtful that it would start demanding loan repayments even if fighting continued for months, and Israeli airstrikes continued to pummel the part of southern Beirut where her branch was located. The Israeli government has long regarded Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy, as a threat, a view compounded by the organisation’s decision tofire rockets into northern Israel from 8 October, the day after the Hamas attack on southern Israel which killed about 1,200 people. While Israel initially said its attacks on Hezbollah were intended to ensure the return of thousands of Israelis to their homes near the border with Lebanon, the broadening escalation has sparked increasing fears of a regional war. Lebanon’s displaced Shia community, huddling in makeshift shelters and bare apartments, might be suffering the immediate shock of displacement in the short term, said Talib, but looked to Hezbollah’s record of rebuilding much of southern Lebanon and fighting Israel’s previous occupation of the area as evidence it could care for them for the long haul. “This party, this special party, liberated their land and gave them the opportunity to go back to their villages and enjoy their lives – they will be with it no matter what, even if it lost its leaders out of nowhere,” she said. “Even if they lost a battle, they won’t lose the war,” she added. “People believe in the party based on their previous experiences. There’s no war without losses, but the winner is the one who wins the last battle.”",Ruth Michaelson

The senior German officials who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed media reports that the US president would travel to Berlin, probably within the next week, but declined to provide further details. Planning for the visit was believed to be ongoing.  German media said Biden would meet the chancellor,Olaf Scholz, and the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, for talks in Berlin on Friday expected to cover Ukraine and the Middle East. Thecancellation of the original tripupended plans for a summit of the Ramstein group of countries providing weapons to Ukraine. The meeting at the US airbase of the same name would have discussed possible new aid commitments to Ukraine. Germany had said the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, would join the event alongside Biden and Scholz, with 20 other leaders expected to attend. It is thought unlikely that such a meeting will take place during Biden’s sharply curtailed rescheduled visit, which was originally slated to last four days. Ukraine’spresident, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had been set at the Ramstein summit to lay out a “victory plan”. When the event was called off, he quickly organised a tour of European capitals to make the case for their enduring support. After talks with Zelenskyy on Friday in Berlin, Scholz announced a €1.4bn (£1.2bn) military aid package forUkraineby the end of 2024, calling it a signal to Russia that the west would not stop backing Kyiv. The aid will be given jointly with partner countries Belgium, Denmark and Norway, and includes more air defence, tanks, combat drones and artillery. “It is a clear message to [Russia’s president, Vladimir] Putin – playing for time will not work. We will not let up in our support for Ukraine,” Scholz said. Germany has been thesecond-biggest supplier of arms to Ukraineafter the US since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Biden’s trip to Berlin would be his first bilateral visit to Germany as president, after he attended the G7 summit at Bavaria’s Elmau castle in June 2022. The original itinerary included a trip to Angola to fulfil a promise to go to Africa as US leader. White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre acknowledged last week that there was little time remaining in Biden’s presidency to reschedule as the US prepares to elect his successor. “Three months is not a long time,” she said. In August, Biden personallythanked Scholzfor his contribution to a large-scale prisoner exchange with Russia involving 26 detainees including the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and the former US Marine Paul Whelan, which hinged onBerlin agreeing to release a jailed FSB hitman.",Deborah Cole

A crowd that gathered earlier in the day for homecoming events at Tennessee State University was beginning to thin out when the gunfire erupted between two groups around 5pm, saidNashvillepolice spokesperson Don Aaron. He said shell casings indicate that gunfire was exchanged across a street near campus between the groups.  The Nashville police commander Anthony McClain said the gunfire didn’t appear to be directly related toTennesseeState University events that had included a parade and other festivities earlier in the day. The football game was taking place in another part of town when the gunfire happened. “It’s unfortunate that a few folks ruined it for everybody,” McClain said. “We have to come to a point to stop this violence.” A police statement on social media said a 24-year-old man died. The victims included two 12-year-olds and a 14-year-old with non-critical injuries, Aaron said. Police spokesperson Brooke Reese said that at least some of the wounded appear to have been involved in the exchange of gunfire. Police and firefighters who had been present for the day’s activities were able to quickly respond to the shooting, authorities said. Fire department spokesperson Kendra Loney said some firefighters used belts as tourniquets. Witness Jashawna Rucker told the television news stationWTVFthat chaos ensued after people heard the shots, and she saw people crying as they ran for safety. “I am thankful I didn’t lose my life or get shot,” Rucker said. Rauf Muhammad toldthe Tennessean newspaperthat he was selling food from a tent along the street when he heard the gunfire and dropped to the ground. “Everybody having fun, music playing or whatnot. Then all of a sudden, you just hear like you off in a war somewhere,” Muhammad told the newspaper. Earlier Saturday in Oklahoma City, 13 people were shot – including one fatally – during a party. That case as well as the one in Nashville helped bring the number of mass shootings reported in the US so far this year to more than 415, according to statistics from theGun Violence Archive. The non-partisan archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more victims are wounded or killed. Constant mass shootings in the US have prompted many in the country to plead for federal lawmakers to provide more substantial gun control, but Congress has largely been unable or unwilling to heed those calls.",
around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/christopher-columbus-was-spanish-and-jewish-documentary-reveals,2024-10-13,"Christopher Columbus may have been Spanish and Jewish, documentary says | Spain | The Guardian",,"A20-year genetic investigation of the remains of Christopher Columbushas turned conventional historical wisdom on its head by concluding that the explorer whose voyage to the New World changed the course of global history may have been a Spanish Jew rather than a son of Genoa. The claim raises the intriguing prospect that the man who played a central part in the creation of Spain’s mighty empire hailed from the very community that his patrons, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, expelled from their kingdom in the same year Columbus reached the Americas.  The findings of the investigation were announced on Saturday night duringa special programme shown on the national broadcaster, RTVE, to coincide with Spain’s national day, which commemorates Columbus’s arrival in the New World on 12 October 1492. José Antonio Lorente, a forensic medical expert at the University of Granada who has led the research, said his analysis had revealed that Columbus’s DNA was “compatible” with a Jewish origin. “We have very partial, but sufficient, DNA from Christopher Columbus,” he said. “We have DNA from his son Fernando Colón, and in both the Y [male] chromosome and mitochondrial DNA [transmitted by the mother] of Fernando there are traces compatible with a Jewish origin.” While Lorente acknowledged that he had not been able to pinpoint Columbus’s place of birth, he said the likelihood was that he had come from the Spanish Mediterranean region. “The DNA indicates that Christopher Columbus’s origin lay in the western Mediterranean,” said the researcher. “If there weren’t Jews in Genoa in the 15th century, the likelihood that he was from there is minimal. Neither was there a big Jewish presence in the rest of the Italian peninsula, which makes things very tenuous.” Given that there were no solid theories nor clear indications that Columbus could have been French, Lorente added, the search area narrowed still further. “We’re left with the Spanish Mediterranean area, the Balearic islands and Sicily. But Sicily would be strange because then Christopher Columbus would have been written with some trace of Italian or the Sicilian language. That all means that his most likely origin is in the Spanish Mediterranean area or the Balearic islands which belonged to the crown of Aragón at the time.” According to RTVE, Lorente’s findings haveput an end to 500 years of speculationover Columbus’s birthplace and nationality. Over the centuries, it has been suggested that the explorer could have been Genoese, Basque, Catalan, Galician, Greek, Portuguese or Scottish. After analysing 25 possible places, then focusing on a shortlist of eight, Lorente alighted on western Europe. His history-changing conclusions, however, have been greeted with extreme caution by some of his peers. “Unfortunately, from a scientific point of view, we can’t really evaluate what was in the documentary because they offered no data from the analysis whatsoever,” Antonio Alonso, a geneticist and former director of Spain’s National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Sciencestold El País. “My conclusion is that the documentary never shows Columbus’s DNA and, as scientists, we don’t know what analysis was undertaken.” Rodrigo Barquera, an expert in archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, said he was surprised the findings had been shared without prior scrutiny from others in the scientific community. “Normally, you send your article to a scientific journal,” hetold El País. “An editor is then assigned to the piece and at least three independent reviewers examine the work and decide whether it’s scientifically valid or not. If it is, it gets published and so the rest of the scientific community can say whether they agree with it or not. Putting it on the screen, far from that dialogue and with all this media focus gets in the way of the scientific community being able to say something about it.” Lorente defended his actions to the same newspaper, saying: “Our team and the university have always considered this study into Christopher Columbus and his family as a single, joined-up and inseparable unit, and nothing will be published until the investigation is completed.” Saturday’s revelation came two days after Lorente and his team said that DNA analysis of the remains of Columbus, his son Fernando and his brother Diego “definitively confirmed” that the partial skeleton kept in a tomb in Seville Cathedralwas that of the famous navigator. Although Columbus died in the Spanish city of Valladolid in 1506, he wanted to be buried on the island of Hispaniola, which is today divided into Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

The claim raises the intriguing prospect that the man who played a central part in the creation of Spain’s mighty empire hailed from the very community that his patrons, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, expelled from their kingdom in the same year Columbus reached the Americas.  The findings of the investigation were announced on Saturday night duringa special programme shown on the national broadcaster, RTVE, to coincide with Spain’s national day, which commemorates Columbus’s arrival in the New World on 12 October 1492. José Antonio Lorente, a forensic medical expert at the University of Granada who has led the research, said his analysis had revealed that Columbus’s DNA was “compatible” with a Jewish origin. “We have very partial, but sufficient, DNA from Christopher Columbus,” he said. “We have DNA from his son Fernando Colón, and in both the Y [male] chromosome and mitochondrial DNA [transmitted by the mother] of Fernando there are traces compatible with a Jewish origin.” While Lorente acknowledged that he had not been able to pinpoint Columbus’s place of birth, he said the likelihood was that he had come from the Spanish Mediterranean region. “The DNA indicates that Christopher Columbus’s origin lay in the western Mediterranean,” said the researcher. “If there weren’t Jews in Genoa in the 15th century, the likelihood that he was from there is minimal. Neither was there a big Jewish presence in the rest of the Italian peninsula, which makes things very tenuous.” Given that there were no solid theories nor clear indications that Columbus could have been French, Lorente added, the search area narrowed still further. “We’re left with the Spanish Mediterranean area, the Balearic islands and Sicily. But Sicily would be strange because then Christopher Columbus would have been written with some trace of Italian or the Sicilian language. That all means that his most likely origin is in the Spanish Mediterranean area or the Balearic islands which belonged to the crown of Aragón at the time.” According to RTVE, Lorente’s findings haveput an end to 500 years of speculationover Columbus’s birthplace and nationality. Over the centuries, it has been suggested that the explorer could have been Genoese, Basque, Catalan, Galician, Greek, Portuguese or Scottish. After analysing 25 possible places, then focusing on a shortlist of eight, Lorente alighted on western Europe. His history-changing conclusions, however, have been greeted with extreme caution by some of his peers. “Unfortunately, from a scientific point of view, we can’t really evaluate what was in the documentary because they offered no data from the analysis whatsoever,” Antonio Alonso, a geneticist and former director of Spain’s National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Sciencestold El País. “My conclusion is that the documentary never shows Columbus’s DNA and, as scientists, we don’t know what analysis was undertaken.” Rodrigo Barquera, an expert in archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, said he was surprised the findings had been shared without prior scrutiny from others in the scientific community. “Normally, you send your article to a scientific journal,” hetold El País. “An editor is then assigned to the piece and at least three independent reviewers examine the work and decide whether it’s scientifically valid or not. If it is, it gets published and so the rest of the scientific community can say whether they agree with it or not. Putting it on the screen, far from that dialogue and with all this media focus gets in the way of the scientific community being able to say something about it.” Lorente defended his actions to the same newspaper, saying: “Our team and the university have always considered this study into Christopher Columbus and his family as a single, joined-up and inseparable unit, and nothing will be published until the investigation is completed.” Saturday’s revelation came two days after Lorente and his team said that DNA analysis of the remains of Columbus, his son Fernando and his brother Diego “definitively confirmed” that the partial skeleton kept in a tomb in Seville Cathedralwas that of the famous navigator. Although Columbus died in the Spanish city of Valladolid in 1506, he wanted to be buried on the island of Hispaniola, which is today divided into Haiti and the Dominican Republic. His remains were taken there in 1542, moved to Cuba in 1795, and then brought to Seville in 1898 when Spain lost control of Cuba after the Spanish-American war.

For a time, he did exactly that. In a glossy, high-concept London campaign launch, the BP boss set out 10 new aims for the company, the most significant being BP’s transformation to a net zero energy company by 2050.  Within months, he reinforced the rebranding with a pledge to cut the company’s oil and gas production by 40% from 2019 levels by the end of the decade. At the time, his strategy even won the approval of Greenpeace – a feat few oil executives can boast. But by early 2023, BP hadwatered down the 40% cut to a 25% reductionafter the war in Ukraine caused oil prices to surge, doubling the company’s profits. Within months, its greenest ever chief executive wasousted from the company amid revelations about undisclosed relationships with colleagues. His green plans have followed suit. It emerged last week that BPplans to abandon its curbs on fossil fuel productionin favour of targeting several new investments in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico. The news angered climate campaigners, but surprised very few. BP’s green retreat has arguably been the most brazen in the industry – from a grandstanding green agenda to a fresh focus on fossil fuels – but the backtrack from environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards is gaining pace among the world’s biggest companies and investors. The term ESG was first coined by the UN in a 2004 report entitled Who Cares Wins. It provided companies and investors with a model for implementing the ideals of responsible investing in their spending plans. By 2015, the idea of ESG had evolved from being a talking point to a set of standards which could, and should, be measured. But in recent years, companies and investors in the US and Europe have begun to chafe at the requirements to disclose their ESG credentials, and retreated from the commitments themselves – often to protect their profits. BP’s oil industry rivalShell signalled earlier this year that it may slow the pace of its emissions reductionsfor this decade by setting a new plan to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade, compared with its previous target of 20%. Shell has also backed away from a pledge to rapidly increase its use of “advanced recycling”, which involvesbreaking down plastic polymersinto tiny molecules that can be made into synthetic fuels or new plastics. It promised to use 1m tonnes of this recycled plastic in its global petrochemicals plants, but later admitted the plan was “unfeasible”. Oil companies are not alone in scaling down their green promises. Volkswagen has quietly dropped a voluntary target to cut CO2₂ emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 30% between 2015 and 2025 in favour of making the same cuts between 2018 and 2030. And Unilever – the conglomerate that owns brands including Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Vaseline, and which is widely credited with pioneering the ESG movement – signalled earlier this year that it wouldabandon or water down a string of ESG pledgesamid a growing backlash from investors and politicians. “It’s a very concerning trend,” said Lewis Johnston, director of policy at the responsible investment organisation ShareAction. “In general, we have seen quite a concerted and organised pushback against some of the principles of responsible investment. It’s a very different philosophy of what generates long-term value.” As recently as 2021, the world’s biggest investors counted ESG principles as important hallmarks of a sound investment. The US investment giants BlackRock and Vanguard voted in favour of almost half of all shareholder ESG resolutions proposed in 2021. But since then they have dramatically withdrawn their support following a fierce political backlash. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, legislators in Texas and other critics of ESG escalated the stakes in late 2022 by collectively pulling billions of dollars in state funds from BlackRock. The investment group’s support for ESG measures has since plummeted. BlackRock has confirmed that in the 12 months to the end of June 2024, it supported only 20 of the 493 environmental and social proposals put forward by shareholders at the annual meetings of the firms in which it invests. This represents just 4% of ESG proposals, compared with 47% three years ago. after newsletter promotion Vanguard supported none of the 400 environmental or social shareholder proposals that it considered in the 2024 US proxy shareholder season, saying they were “overly prescriptive”, unnecessary or did not relate to material financial risks. Gemma Woodward, the head of responsible investment at the UK wealth management firm Quilter Cheviot, highlighted the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a tipping point in the trend against ESG. “We saw a real turn in the market where value came back into fashion, and so we saw an ‘easing of the pedal’ of the interest in [ESG],” she said. “I’m very worried, obviously … I guess the problem we’ve got is that we don’t have a global standard.” However, BP and Shell still looked “pretty good” compared with oil companies in the US, where there was an even bigger backlash against ESG, Woodward said. US banks JP Morgan and State Street pulled out of the Climate Action 100+ investor group, which pushes for change from big greenhouse gas emitters, this year. “It’s certainly at its most extreme in the US,” Johnston said. “But we’re not immune to it in the UK or in Europe.” Last summer, the EU confirmed plans to water down the final rules for corporate ESG disclosures through the European Sustainability Reporting Standards. The move comes after European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, pledged to cut red tape across the EU executive’s work to counter complaints from big companies over the mounting cost of environmental rules. Under the new rules, companies will have more flexibility to decide what information is “material” and therefore should be reported, in effect making some disclosures voluntary instead of mandatory. The easing was described by HSBC analysts at the time as a “step back” in ambition and robustness, but a step that may facilitate convergence in sustainability reporting globally. Johnston insisted that climate transition reporting should not be considered yet as another raft of burdensome reporting rules. Instead, he said, it was about making sure companies were aware of both the risks and the opportunities involved in adapting to the climate crisis. “Mandatory [climate] transition plans are a means of empowering companies and positioning the financial system as a whole, and aligning that and the real economy with the transition that we know is coming,” Johnston said. “So I think it’s absolutely wrong to look at this as merely another regulatory burden, because it really isn’t … It’s about imposing discipline and making sure that companies are preparing for what they should be doing, and that’s, again, responsible stewardship.”",Jillian Ambrose

A draft statement arrived at by consensus by the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations was put to the 18-nation East Asia Summit meeting in Laos on Thursday evening, the official said.  “Asean presented this final draft and said that, essentially, this was a take-it-or-leave-it draft,” the official said on condition of anonymity. The United States, Japan, Australia, South Korea and India all said they could support it, the official said, adding: “The Russians and the Chinese said that they could not and would not proceed with a statement.” The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told a news conference in Vientiane on Friday the final declaration had not been adopted because of “persistent attempts by the United States, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to turn it into a purely political statement”. China’s Washington embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The US official said there were a couple of issues of contention, but the key one was how it referred to the UN convention on the law of the sea (Unclos), going further than in the previous 2023 EAS statement. However, the official said, “there was certainly no language that was getting into the nitty gritty of any particular standoff, no language that was favouring any claimant over any other”. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea and hasstepped up pressureon rival claimants, including several Asean countries, notably the Philippines. Asean has spent years negotiating a code of conduct with Beijing for the strategic waterway, with some Asean states insisting it be based on Unclos. China says it backs a code, but does not recognise a 2016 arbitral ruling that said its claim to most of the South China Sea had no basis under Unclos, to which Beijing is a signatory. According to a draft seen by Reuters, the proposed EAS statement contained an extra sub-clause over the 2023 approved statement, and this was not agreed to. It noted a2023 UN resolutionsaying that Unclos “sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out”. Another sub-clause not agreed said the international environment, including “in the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, Myanmar, Ukraine and the Middle East ... present challenges for the region”. The Chinese premier, Li Qiang, told the summit Beijing was committed to Unclos and striving for an early conclusion of a code of conduct, while stressing its claims have solid historical and legal grounds. “Relevant countries outside the region should respect and support the joint efforts of China and regional countries to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, and truly play a constructive role for peace and stability in the region,” he said.",
around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/china-communist-party-banned-books-rules-xi-jinping,,China cracks down on Communist party officials for reading banned books | China | The Guardian,,"When Lam Wing-kee ran his bookshop in Hong Kong, filled with controversial and political titles banned in mainlandChina, many of his customers were Chinese Communist party officials. Back then, in the early years of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s reign, and before Lam was detainedby Chinese authoritiesfor his work, the officials would load up boxes of books on CCP politics, Chinese economics, and scandal, often taking them back over the border.  “CCP officials would look for books about what’s going on in China, about changes in the top rank officials, who gets the most power, changes in the power and the struggle between them, etcetera,” Lam tells the Guardian, suggesting officials were often buying the books to learn about what was going on inside their own party. “Some of my customers were high-ranking members of the CCP,” he said. But today, such purchases are coming back to bite their buyers. Several recent corruption cases against CCP officials have included accusations of procuring or reading banned materials. The officials have so far received internal disciplinary actions, including being expelled from the party, but observers are watching to see if criminal charges follow. In September a former municipal level official in Heilongjiang, Li Bin, accused of corruption, was also found to have “privately read an illegal publication containing contents that undermined the unity and solidarity of the Party”, according to state media. He was expelled from the Party and his case given to prosecutors. That same month, Cheng Zhiyi, former party secretary of Chongqing’s Jiangjin district, was also expelled. Among the accusations were “losing ideals and beliefs” after he privately read books and magazines with “serious political problems’ while “outside the country”. Henan official Yang Lei also was accused of “losing ideals and beliefs and abandoning the original mission” when he violated “political discipline and national laws”, including bringing prohibited books into the country, according to CCTV in August. A recent report by the South China Morning Postsaidat least a dozen cases this year had prominently included accusations of reading or procuring banned materials, up from seven last year. They emphasise illicit reading ahead of other crimes like bribery. Wen-ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, attributes the rush of punishments to new performance targets for party discipline bureaucrats tasked with “punishing those who are deemed disparaging of the party’s image, principles, or policies, as well as those who are in possession of material that could have such effect.” “The Chinese Communist party champions itself as always ‘great, glorious, and correct’. This image of infallibility must not be challenged, lest it threatens the governing legitimacy of the party,” he said.  of the corruption cases publicly reveal what reading materials the fallen cadres had accessed. But a list of banned titlespublishedby China Digital Times offers some possibilities. The list includes writings on Chinese politics and history, including the Tiananmen Square massacre and the disastrous Mao-era policies that saw millions die from famine, violence, and political purges. There are books scrutinising the modern CCP’s politics and power, or sharing the views of political enemies and critics like Hong Kong tycoon and activist Jimmy Lai, the exiled Tibetan Dalai Lama, and Bo Xilai, the fallen political foe of Xi Jinping. Hillary Clinton’s memoir is on the list, as is Machiavelli’s The Prince, and Hannah Arendt’s The Origins of Totalitarianism. Many of the banned books line the shelves of Lam’s new shop in downtown Taipei, which hereopenedin 2020 afterfleeing to the Taiwanese capital in exile. Xi’s leadership has been particularly noteworthy for its purges of political rivals and crushing of factionalism. Discussion, criticism, even gossip, has become more and more dangerous for those trying to survive politically. As Xi’s grip tightens, it will be interesting to see if the illicit reading cases move beyond Party disciplinary proceedings and start to attract criminal charges, says law Prof Margaret Lewis, of Seton Hall University. “It’s not like in the past people would be like ‘I’ll just take an unauthorised biography of Bo Xilai down the coffee shop’. But it’s a matter of turning up the temperature, not totally changing the climate” says Lewis. “But it goes to show the power of information and books. They care enough to say this is punishable infraction.”",Helen Davidson

Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that its forces had recaptured two villages in the border Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched a mass incursion in August. Zelenskyy has acknowledged that the Ukrainian advance into Kursk was intended to draw Russian troops away from frontline positions in eastern Ukraine. Prosecutors in Donetsk region on Saturday said two people were killed in Russian strikes on villages near Kurakhove. The general staff of Ukraine’s military, in a late evening report, reported 47 clashes in the area around Kurakhove and 27 more in the Pokrovsk sector to the north-west. It follows Russia’s defence ministry on Friday announcing the capture of Ostrivske, a village on a reservoir near the town of Kurakhove, a key Russian target in itsadvance through the Donetskregion. Ukraine has not acknowledged the loss of the village, but military bloggers have reported Russian advances in the area. Ukrainian military recruitment officers have raided restaurants, bars and a concert hall in Kyiv, checking military registration documents and detaining men who are not in compliance. Local media reported Saturday that officers intercepted men leaving a concert by Ukrainian rock band Okean Elzy and some were forcibly detained. It is unusual for such raids to take place in the capital, and reflects Ukraine’s dire need for fresh recruits. Raids also reportedly took place in clubs and restaurants in other cities. All Ukrainian men aged 25-60 are eligible for conscription, and men aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the country. The Kremlin said on Saturday that the Democrat party presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s description of Vladimir Putin as a “murderous dictator” exposed how politicians in Washington sought to impose their views on the world.Peskov’s comments appeared to be in response to Harris’s criticism of a report in a newly released book by US journalist Bob Woodward that Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump, while in office,had sent Covid tests to Russiaat the height of the pandemic. In a radio interview, she described Putin as a “murderous dictator”. Leaders of the group of atomic bomb survivorsawarded the Nobel Peace Prizewarned on Saturday that the risk of nuclear war was rising, renewing their call to abolish nuclear weapons. “The international situation is getting progressively worse, and now wars are being waged as countries threaten the use of nuclear weapons,” said Shigemitsu Tanaka, a survivor of the 1945 US bombing of Nagasaki and co-head of the Nihon Hidankyo group. Vladimir Putin signalled last month that Moscow would consider responding with nuclear weapons if the US and its allies allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range western missiles. Ukraine’s military said on Saturday that it struck a Russian-controlled oil terminal in the partially occupied Luhansk regionthat provides fuel for Russia’s war effort. Russian state media reported that the terminal close to the city of Rovenky had come under attack from a Ukrainian drone and said there were no casualties and that the fire had been extinguished, but did not comment on the extent of any damage. Russian emergency services said they had brought a massive fire under control at the Feodosia oil terminal in Russian-annexed Crimea,which had burned for six days after being struck by Ukraine, state news agency Ria Novosti reported. Russia’s defence ministry said 47 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted and destroyed by its air defence systems overnight into Saturday: 17 over the Krasnodar region, 16 over the Sea of ​​Azov, 12 over the Kursk region and two over the Belgorod region, all of which border Ukraine. Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Saturday that one person had been killed and 14 wounded in Ukrainian shelling and drone attacks over the previous 24 hours. In Ukraine, the country’s air force said air defences had shot down 24 of 28 drones launched overnight against Ukraine.

Declining water levels from global heating have been exacerbated by increasing levels of extraction from the Volga and the Ural, the Russian rivers that flow into it. Satellite photographs show thesea shrinkingat a dramatic rate.

multimedia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/nightcap-national-park-rainforest-trees-age-bushfires-impact,,"They are relics of the Gondwana age but five years after Australia’s black summer these trees are dying a ‘long, slow death’ | Bushfires | The Guardian",,"Thousands of years of accumulated leaf fall makes the ground bounce like a mattress underfoot and, high above, rainforest coachwood trees form a dense canopy that dresses the understory in permanent shade. Some of the unique plants in this rainforest can trace their lineage back 40 or 50m years when the Gondwana supercontinent was breaking apart and Australia was detaching itself from what is now Antarctica.  Take only a few steps from the cool shade and you emerge to something altogether different. Still rainforest, but changing fast. Soil and rocks are exposed and, above, the leafless branches of tall and dead trees let the sunlight strike the forest floor. This is a place packed with threatened species, including the nightcap oak – a true Gondwanan relic that grows nowhere else. On the ground and at the base of the thin-barked trees is charcoal. Five years ago, chunks of this rainforest not evolved to burn, did burn, during what became known as Australia’s black summer bushfires. “It can take a lot of these trees a long time to die. It is a long, slow death,” says Dr Robert Kooyman, an evolutionary ecologist who has spent more than 40 years working and studying the rainforests in and around Nightcap national park in northernNew South Wales. About 73,000 sq km of forest were burned in the east and south of the country during black summer and the fires scorched the habitat of about3 billion native animals. Half of the world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests – a network of 40 parks and reserves – were affected by the fires that were driven by global heating. Fires burned into about 10% of the rainforest in the Nightcap area and affected about 30% of the rainforest’s margin, says Kooyman. Kooyman discovered the nightcap oak in the late 1980s. Unlike Australia’s many eucalypt species, rainforest trees have not evolved to deal with fire. “It burns around the base and it cooks the cambium layer – the live wood – and the bark. It triggers this slow-motion death and you can see the progressive stages here,” he says, pointing to trees in various stages of that slow death. The fires killed about a third of the mature nightcap oaks, he says, leaving 181 behind. Kooyman’s monitoring shows 72 of those are struggling to survive, or have lost their main stem and now persist “as suckers only”. “That one’s on the way out,” says Kooyman, pointing to a nightcap whose bark and stem is split and is covered by fungi. “That one is failing too,” says Kooyman, pointing to another. “And this was a low-intensity burn.” There is smoke in the air from a nearby hazard reduction burn on the day Kooyman takes us to the marked-out plots where he and colleagues are monitoring every post-fire breath, death and revival. Traps made from net and laundry baskets catch and record whatever falls from the canopy; straps called dendrometers measure trunk growth; and then there are recordings of temperature, humidity, light and seed generation, and the state of the soil. “They can shrink before they die,” says Kooyman, pointing to one of the dendrometers. “The theory of negative growth is real – that would drive the economists crazy,” he laughs. As we leave to look at another patch of burnt rainforest, Kooyman yanks a young wattle that’s sprouting. The fires removed the leaf litter on the forest floor, creating a perfect bed for dormant wattle seeds to germinate. They have been growing at an incredible density – as many as 30,000 a hectare (12,100 an acre). “They’ll create a fire influence inside the rainforest,” he says. “If we had a dry season and another fire, there are huge amounts of this vegetation that would explode in flames. That’s the problem. You end up with a fire-prone landscape.” The fires here were followed within months by torrential rain and violent floods that blasted the banks of the rock-strewn creeks and swept away weakened trees and plants. Kooyman used to see platypus here but since the fires, there’s no sign. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion More than once on this day, Kooyman bristles when the word “recovery” comes up. For fire-adapted forests, the word “recovery” might be fair, but not for rainforests, he says. “Let’s not let this terminology overwhelm us. This is not recovery,” he says, pointing to a 2ft-tall sucker growing from the base of a dead trunk. “What we have discovered is that even after almost five years, the trajectory is still in reverse. The impacts are accumulating and it hasn’t stabilised.” “Do we want these forests in the future? Do we log them? Do we have them crisped by climate change, or do we start compensating for what we know is happening and protect them?” The fire that hit Nightcap national park and the neighbouring Whian Whian state conservation area started in late October as a lightning strike and gained momentum as the extreme heat and dry of 2019 was joined by winds. Kooyman is an honorary research fellow at Sydney’s Macquarie University, a researcher at the city’s Royal Botanical Gardens and scientist with Missouri Botanical Gardens programs in west Africa and Madagascar. But he lives less than an hour’s drive from Nightcap and got to his beloved rainforest within days as the ground was still smouldering. “I did find myself, not depressed but, maybe like PTSD working in these impact zones. I’m not inclined to any level of depression, but this has had an impact on me. You catch yourself being a little angrier or shorter [tempered] than usual. “Having never lived through these sorts of events at those scales it takes some adjusting.” Kooyman is 71, but he moves like someone half his age. Several times this morning, he jumps from his four-wheel drive to chainsaw trees that have fallen across the track. “I’m feeling an urgency now and it’s not so much down to my sunset clause,” he says. In a break, he puts his laptop on the bonnet to show some images of his plots. They look like landscape ink drawings of the forest you might hang on your wall. But these delicate strokes are the artefacts of data from laser scans of the parts of the forest he’s been monitoring. The areas that escaped the fire have a dense and continuous canopy shrouding the understory. But the scans taken from areas that burned show a canopy that is barely a canopy at all. Technology is moving fast and Kooyman is excited that new approaches, like LiDAR scanning, could give him answers to questions he has been chasing his whole career. “We’re getting deeper insights into how these rainforest systems work. So I’m excited,” he says. “But the irony is we’re getting better at measuring decline.”",Graham Readfearn

It led him back home, to capture a side of contemporary Australia you won’t see in Crocodile Dundee. When Ferguson started taking portraits around Australia in 2013, people would occasionally ask him where he was from. He grew up in Dubbo, but his years as a US-based photojournalist for the New Yorker, Time, National Geographic and the New York Times had apparently sanded the strine from his accent. He had been asking himself similar kinds of questions – about his place in the world, and the stories his camera captured.  Chairs secured from flooding, Iningai Country, Lake Huffer Station, Queensland, 2017. “I started to feel like I was quite disconnected as an expat living overseas,” Ferguson says. “At some point I felt like I had a bit of … a crisis might be dramatic, but I just started to lose my sense of identity.” Over the next decade he continued to venture further into the continent that was, on paper, his home. With camera in hand, Ferguson would travel from a “super pit” goldmine in Kalgoorlie, on Wangkatha Country, to the Broken Hill Correctional Centre, on Wilyakali Country, to the almond plantations of Robinvale, on Latje Latje Country. His “ultimate intention” was to “reframe, and make a contemporary portrait, of ‘the bush’ that I hadn’t seen before”, His new monograph, Big Sky, collects a decade of photography that Ferguson hopes disrupts the familiar and – at times – reductive representations of regional Australia seen across the political and media landscape. Sheep are fed with bought feed during drought, Weilwan Country, Epping Farm, Pilliga, New South Wales, 2018. Ferguson’s medium format film camera lingers on a young cattle worker posing tentatively in front of a grove of pink bougainvillaea; a drag queen under a Hills Hoist preparing for a Priscilla: Queen of the Desert tribute show; and a pair of young Aboriginal women in Taylor Swift T-shirts looking out over Wadeye, in the Northern Territory. Many of Ferguson’s portraits invoke and subvert well-worn national iconography familiar from Wake in Fright to Baz Luhrmann’s Australia. “One of the things I’ve tried to do in my work is find archetypal Australian characters, like drovers, roo shooters, things that have been packed up in popular culture.” That led him to Billy Skinner, a drover who he first met in 2018, and kept running into. “He only ever called me ‘Kodak’, he’d never call me Adam,” Ferguson says. Watching men like Skinner at work, it occurred to Ferguson that a 21st-century drover’s life is a long way from Clancy of the Overflow. Today, their work is shaped by climate change, hired by farmers to move stock around to less drought-stricken feeding grounds. “Many of the farmers I encountered don’t believe in climate change, the vast majority,” Ferguson says. “But the reality is the modern iteration of the classic drover archetype isn’t moving cattle around for transport – it’s for weather patterns.” Billy Skinner, drover, Koa Country, Winton, Queensland, 2022. With Skinner’s Akubra cast to the ground, Ferguson’s 2022 shot of the denim-clad stockman tenderly holding his face to his horse’s neck subverts the archetype of a heroic horseman sitting high in the saddle. “He literally lives in a trailer on a stock route for the majority of the year, and lives with these horses and sleeps next to cattle. His whole existence comes from looking after cows, on the back of a horse, and occasionally a motorbike. I wanted to show the relationship to that horse, that kind of intimacy.” Ferguson was similarly drawn to the mythic figure of the sheep shearer, but his shirtless portraits of tattooed 30-year-old contract shearer Conan Wakefield and his 50-year-old father, George Smith, deliberately pushes back against the old romance of the shearing shed. “It didn’t matter what I did, it just felt like I was making an image that we’d already seen,” Ferguson says of his initial attempts to capture the men at work. “And that was beautiful, in a sense, [but] I wanted to veer away from that. Now, shearers are itinerant workers, and the industry’s nowhere as big as it used to be.” Conan Wakefield, shearer, Iningai Country, Marchmont Station, Queensland, 2017. At times, Ferguson’s work documenting drought and bushfire saw him meet the challenges of climate change almost literally head-on. One of the more recent photographs was taken in Pyramul, on Wiradjuri Country, in 2023, of a burnt-out truck in a field still smoking from the fire that had just swept through. “Half an hour before I took that photo I watched the fire come down, me and the [Rural Fire Service] guys. There was only one road in and out, and we had to gather in a paddock and get ready to watch a fire front rip through us. Everyone got really nervous, and we were all there bracing for it. Then, at the last minute, the wind had changed, and it moved north.” Conscious that he was far from the first white man with a camera to document the continent’s interior, Ferguson also took care to give his subjects agency and avoid reinforcing stereotypes or tropes – including gaining approval from elders for images depicting First Nations communities. Kooringle farm after a bushfire an hour earlier on Sallys Flat Road, Wiradjuri Country, Pyramul, New South Wales, 2023, “The very process of photography is steeped in all kinds of colonial complexities. The thing that I really tried to do is make images that empower people, or depicted people in a way that gave us dignity and agency.” One striking image sees Pastor Simon Dixon, a Pintupi-Luritja and Lutheran priest, standing arms outstretched in front of the rolling hills of Ikuntji/Haast Bluff, Arrernte Country, the colours straight out of an Albert Namatjira watercolour. Ferguson had met the pastor months earlier, and envisioned taking his portrait out on Country in the vestments of a coloniser’s religion. But the pastor had other plans first. Pintupi-Luritja Lutheran pastor Simon Dixon, Ikuntji/Haast Bluff, Arrernte Country, Northern Territory, 2023. “I sat after church service in the morning, slept in my Land Cruiser for most of the day, because the light was crap and I knew I wanted to do it in afternoon light. And then, at the time we decided to shoot, Pastor Simon comes out and says, ‘Oh, we’re going hunting’. “So I jumped in the car with him and a few of these fellas, and we went hunting. We got back half an hour before sundown, and he was like, ‘Let’s do it’.” After a frantic 20-minute drive, Pastor Simon had led Ferguson to the perfect spot with moments of light left. “The sun went away and I was like, ‘Hopefully I got it’,” Ferguson says, in an accent that is, once again, unmistakably Australian. The final portrait is a poignant lesson in having a bit of faith. But, like the rest of Ferguson’s work, it’s a complicated picture.",Walter Marsh

Huque, a freelance photographer, took this image on an iPhone 13 Pro Max at South Surma dumping site, in Sylhet. The garbage of the Sylhet City Corporation is brought here on a daily basis. “At an age when they should be heading off with a school bag on their shoulder, children like these are instead involved in a battle for their livelihood,” says Huque, who has an eight-month-old son. “Many people lost their homes in recent years due to frequent Covid outbreaks, floods, river erosion and other calamities, and they were forced to resettle in the city in search of a better future. Now they earn their living by filling plastic bags at the yard with bottles and selling them to factories in the city.” There’s no knowing where the parents of these children are, Huque adds.

This acronym is an ethos that drives the Australian purpose-driven accounting firm’s mission to give back and help clients measure the positive effect they are having on the world.  “We aim to transform traditional accounting services into a vehicle for greater societal impact,” says the firm’s co-founder Amar Latif. To make this vision a reality, Latif is upskilling in emerging areas of advisory. He’s part of a growing group of progressive accountants and bookkeepers who are prioritising professional development, while future-proofing their practices along the way. Providing development opportunities has helped practice owners such as Latif attract and retain talent in a tight labour market; 40% of firms surveyed for Xero’s2023 State of the industryreport said they were appealing to potential new hires by offering benefits such as upskilling and training. MAD Wealth has used learning platforms such asTaxBanterandKnowledge Shop, which offer tax and business advisory training. Beyond this, Latif says he’s also invested in specialised courses in carbon accounting and environmental sustainability. The former is a way for businesses to track the amount of greenhouse gases they emit, acting as a ledger for climate impact that sits alongside regular financial reporting. It’s a skill that’s keeping MAD Wealth ahead of the curve; the Xero report found that 18% of practices offer sustainability reporting consulting. Some of the other courses Latif and his team have completed include advanced tax law and digital accounting solutions. “Keeping across the latest tax regulations and digital tools, including those offered by Xero, ensures we can optimise our clients’ financial strategies and operational efficiencies,” he says. Hot Toastis another advisory firm that uses education to drive practice performance. Sarah Lawrance is Hot Toast’s director and primary consultant. She says the firm holds a unique position in the accounting and advisory market, specialising in support for growing creative, digital, startup and real estate businesses. The practice has always been proactive and innovative, which has helped drive its success along the way. “We knew that early on education and learning was the cornerstone of that,” she says. Lawrance sees the widespread adoption of AI-powered technologies as a huge opportunity for accounting and bookkeeping firms. She has spent the past six months exploring the potential of AI in her practice, hiring developers, and bringing her team on the journey, from formal courses in machine learning to self-directed experimentation. “I get a kick out of learning about AI because it’s back-to-basics numbers and maths,” she says. Lawrance says these new skills have allowed her to make more informed business decisions. “I have limited resources, so I need the best return on investment when I’m looking at cashflow or resource allocation. AI can help me do that.” Lawrance’s newly gained knowledge has allowed her to apply AI to her firm’s workflows to boost efficiencies. “We’ve taken every process at a transaction, bookkeeping and tax level and built AI processes around them. All of a sudden, there are fewer errors and things get done quickly.” Integrating automation has augmented Hot Toast’s services, meaning the business is able to do more with less. “When you’re a smaller business competing with bigger businesses, you have to be smart and agile, make decisions and fail fast quickly, and I’m using AI to achieve this,” Lawrance says. A key finding from Xero’s report reveals that small businesses are increasingly relying on advisory firms for support beyond traditional accounting and compliance. In particular, practices said they were providing more expanded offerings in areas such as app/software setup (34%) HR advisory (30%), startup mentoring/business development (26%), and advice on capital raising (22%). This creates opportunities for accountants and bookkeepers to not only level up their skills in emerging areas, but also build better relationships with their clients and provide higher-value holistic services. Latif says staying focused on upskilling means he can offer clients services that move beyond historical reporting and focus more on their goals and purpose. “We build close relationships with clients and become their go-to resource for strategic decision-making and problem-solving,” he says. “This ensures we - MAD Wealth – can effectively partner with clients as trusted advisers, helping them unlock the good in their businesses and make a difference in the world.” Tax time is better off on Xero.

To Goodrem, who was just 18 at the time, having something comforting to regularly look forward to became an important part of her fight against cancer. Twenty years on, Goodrem has joined forces with the skincare brand La Roche-Posay in support of its new international Fight With Care campaign.  Cancer treatments can produce lots of mental and physical side-effects, one of which is skin irritations, which canaffect more than 80%of patients. La Roche-Posay has led studies on more than 11,000 cancer patients, and its new initiative aims to raise awareness about the dermatological side-effects of cancer treatments – the itching, burning, scars and acute dryness that can occur – while educating healthcare professionals, patients and loved ones about relief methods for the skin before, during and after treatments. Founded in a French town of the same name in 1975 (home to a thermal spring from which the company sources water for its products), La Roche-Posay develops skincare products for the most sensitive skin types. In 2008 the company began exploring the effects of cancer treatments on the skin, and formed an advisory board of oncologists and dermatologists that developed recommendations on how to manage cutaneous toxicities with dermocosmetic solutions – with the aim of improving cancer patients’ quality of life. Now the brand has produced a comprehensive patient support guide that helps people care for their skin when fighting cancer. Questions a patient might have on this subject are answered by experts: How do I moisturise and protect my skin? How do I respond to my itchy and dry skin? How do I deal with an inflamed hair follicle? What should I do before and after my radiotherapy session? How do I take care of my scars? How do I best apply makeup? La Roche-Posay also offers afree, 15-minute online training sessionfor patients and caregivers, covering four components of supportive care: mental health; hair, skin and nails; mouth, stomach and nutrition; and pain and fatigue. In addition, La Roche-Posay has recently announced it will commit significant funding to the Princess Alexandra Research Foundation in Queensland to create an onco-dermatology clinic, which will allow oncology patients experiencing skin impacts to have direct access to specialised dermatological care through the hospital. Professor Kiarash Khosrotehrani, the director of dermatology at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, says: “Over three-quarters of cancer patients grapple with severe skin side-effects resulting from treatment. The severity of these side-effects can even compel patients to halt or delay their therapy, even though these consequences can be mitigated by implementing straightforward skincare protocols, such as cleansing, moisturising, sun protecting and using protective products. “There is more that can be done to support cancer patients in achieving skin comfort, and that’s why La Roche-Posay’sFight With Carecampaign is so important.” Through advisory boards, the skincare brand also identified nurses’ critical roles in oncology patient support. This insight inspired a partnership with the breast cancer support charity the McGrath Foundation. The three-year collaboration will see La Roche-Posay sponsor an oncology nurse in the community, supporting women undergoing treatment. A person diagnosed with cancer is in the fight of their life, and according to research conducted by La Roche-Posay, 80% of cancer patients say supportive care is as important as treatments. If cancer patients can find relief from their skin reactions, have educated loved ones and professionals around them (and maybe enjoy a hot chocolate from their local gardening store every so often), they might have a more comfortable experience. Whether you’re undergoing cancer treatment or are a loved one of someone who is, take La Roche-Posay’s online cancer support course to ensure you’re equipped with credible information on how to best care for the parts of the journey that are less talked about.",

We discussed many strategies, such as the importance of moisturising, skin protection and wearing gloves when washing dishes. Once the skin was healed, we recommenced treatment and continued these new strategies to proactively prevent and manage adverse skin effects.” Many people going through cancer treatments experience adverse skin side-effects; itching, burning, scars, severe dryness, the list goes on. Grewal’s appointment at the McGrath Foundation is made possible by skincare brand La Roche-Posay, which has been studying the skin impacts of cancer treatments for 15 years. As a part of its Fight With Care initiative, the brand has struck a three-year partnership with the McGrath Foundation and will sponsor Grewal as she continues her vital role in oncology care in the community. The McGrath Foundation’s CEO, Holly Masters, says: “When you’re diagnosed with cancer, it feels like your world has imploded. Suddenly, you’re bombarded with lots of new language, you don’t know which way to turn, or what information to trust. What a McGrath nurse does is enable you to take one day at a time and make really good decisions based on what is right for you, and what is right for your family, in order to ensure you can be the person that you want to be during what really is a traumatic time. “A nurse can provide very tailored support – emotional, psychological, psychosocial and physical help – all the way from the day of diagnosis through to treatment. It’s that bespoke level of care that genuinely makes a difference.” La Roche-Posay was founded in 1975 in the French town of the same name. In 2008, the company began focusing on the effects of cancer treatments on the skin. It formed an advisory board of oncologists and dermatologists who reviewed updated scientific data to develop suitable dermocosmetic solutions – with the aim of helping to improve quality of life for those undergoing cancer treatment. “The reality is most patients have skin reactions,” Masters says. “I’ve heard of people who did not want to walk out of their front door because of the way they felt they looked. One of the things that we hear very often is if they look normal, they feel much more confident about going outside and living a normal life. “If you have something that signifies you’re sick – whether it is losing your hair or having reactions and your skin being really impacted – that’s a signal for somebody else to say, ‘Goodness, are you OK?’ And as someone going through treatment, you are having to have that conversation all the time.” La Roche-Posay joined the McGrath Foundation as a nurse partner in June 2023, a move for which Masters is incredibly grateful. The support charity has 204 breast care nurses, and aims to have 250 by 2025. “The partnership means the world to us here at the foundation,” Masters says. “It allowed us to bring on board Gurpreet, who is one of our amazing nurses. Gurpreet works with people who have advanced cancer and effectively they have much greater complexities in their lives because they don’t just have tumours in their breast. “Gurpreet is an incredible nurse and without the support of La Roche-Posay – there is such an integrity in the work that the skincare company is doing – we wouldn’t be able to have Gurpreet supporting so many people.” Grewal says: “I am available via phone, email, text message and face to face. I am there when people are first diagnosed and continue to support them throughout their entire cancer experience. A consistent point of contact, a familiar face in a time of uncertainty and complicated healthcare systems.” Now that is fighting with care.

explore,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/oct/13/why-everything-you-think-about-living-to-100-might-be-wrong,,Why everything you think about living to 100 might be wrong | Ageing | The Guardian,,"Tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson is talking about 16th-century sailors. Back then, he says, circumnavigating the globe was the height of human achievement. But those sailors, some of whom were coincidentally hoping to find a mythical fountain of youth, left port without knowing what really lay ahead. The same is true forJohnson, 47, who sees himself as a modern-day explorer. Like those sailors, he too is pushing the bounds of what is humanly attainable. Not by circumnavigating the globe, but by circumventing death. Johnson’s odyssey involves ingesting111 pillsa day, eating his last (vegan) meal of the day at 11am, staying teetotal, doing an hour of exercise daily and going to bed at 8.30pm. But is it scientifically possible to slow our ageing like this? Or is his plan more likely to end up shipwrecked by reality?  Living to even 100 is extremely difficult. In his recent bookJellyfish Age Backwards, the Danish molecular biologist Nicklas Brendborg estimated that it’s as hard to survive from 93 to 100 as it is to make it from birth to 93. And most would consider 93 a decent innings. “Your chance of being sick or dying increases exponentially with time,” says Prof Richard Faragher from Brighton University. Plentiful evidence suggests that a healthy lifestylecan add up to 14 years to our lives. But given UK life expectancy is about 81, this isn’t likely to make us centenarians. Anda new studyshows that the rise in life expectancy is slowing down. But if we adoptextremelyhealthy lifestyles, might we liveextremelylong lives? Not really. Extreme longevity is seemingly more genetically driven than normal ageing, meaning diet and exercise may only have a limited impact, says Lynne Cox, an Oxford University professor. “I don’t think there’s a panacea that’s going to add 20 or 30 years to human life at the moment,” she says. Take exercise – which clearly is good for us. One study of 55- to 79-year-old amateur cyclistsfound they were biologically young for their age. In particular, their immune systems hadn’t declined like their non-exercising peers. But that doesn’t mean we should do ever more exercise.Another recent studyon Finnish twins, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found moderate exercisers were biologically younger than those who did no exercise – and, strikingly, those who did a lot. “You really want to be in the sweet spot with exercise,” says Cox. “Super fit athletes don’t necessarily seem to be living any longer.” As for diet, research shows that cutting calories candouble the lifespan of nematode worms. Meanwhile, calorie-restricted mice can live about 30-40% longer, particularlyif they do intermittent fasting. Results in rhesus monkeys have been contradictory, but calorie-restricted monkeys appear healthier andmay livea couple of extra years. Johnson, who is restricting his calories by 10%, is hoping it will work for him, too. But the restrictions in the animal studies are large (a 30-40% reduction in calories) and humans aren’t mice – or nematode worms. While a few studiesshow health benefits for humans,it’s difficult to verify that participants really maintained the restricted diets. Plus, says Cox, “it’s very, very hard to not become malnourished if you’re cutting out 30% of your calories. It can actually be detrimental.” This is particularly true if you’re older, losing muscle mass, or restricting your calories indefinitely. Research shows older, calorie-restricted miceare at a higher risk of dying from infections. Weight-loss jabs such as Ozempic are also popular among longevity enthusiasts – though Johnson says he hasn’t tried it. New research shows they cut the risk of many age-related diseases,including cardiovascular diseasesand cancer,leaving researchers optimisticthey could extend life. But we won’t know their impact on lifespan for decades. They also come with potentially life-threatening side-effects, including pancreatitis. It’s also worth noting that skinny people don’t seem to live the longest. Strikingly, overweight peoplelive longerthan their underweight, normal and obese peers. Some people do enjoy very long lives. The world’s “blue zones” (regions identified as having populations who live healthier and longer lives than others) – which include Sardinia in Italy, Okinawa in Japan andIkaria in Greece–have spawned an industryof lifestyle interventions, supplements and cookbooks. But a study by Saul Newman from University College London, which is now being peer reviewed, suggests much data on human centenarians is bogus. “I tracked down 80% of the people in the world who were older than 110,” says Newman, who found almost none of them had a birth certificate. “It’s a statistical garbage pile.” Alarm bells have been ringing for a while. In 2010, aJapanese government reviewdiscovered 230,000 of the country’s centenarians were missing – presumably dead. And Newman says data suggests that some 72% of Greek centenarians are dead or missing, but their relatives haven’t declared as much, possibly to keep collecting their pensions. Newman believes this is why blue zones appear in poor, rural areas, places where there’s substandard record-keeping and pressure to commit pension fraud. In the UK, the relatively poor London borough of Tower Hamlets has thehighest proportion of 105-year-oldsin the country, despite having a lower-than-average life expectancy overall. And longevity is linked to wealth – the countries in the world with the highest average life expectancy are rich ones. “The old-age suicide rate in Okinawa is the fourth highest in Japan. They have twice the poverty rate of any other prefect. They’re last in Japan for vegetable consumption,” says Newman. “If you pretend that everything’s great in Okinawa, you are leaving those people behind – you’re exploiting them to sell cookbooks.” “He’s right,” says Nir Barzilai, a longevity researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who has studied Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians in the US and their families. “It’s a real problem.” However, he argues records are fairly reliable in the US. And his team looks at many different documents, including passports, voting records and the ages of family members, to verify their centenarians. His own results do differ from those based on blue zones. Barzilai’s centenariansdidn’t have very healthy lifestyles, for example. “Half of them were overweight or obese, half of them were smoking, half of them weren’t exercising, and very few were vegetarians,” he says. But they were healthy – having onlyhalf the incidence of cardiovasular disease. “They have genes that slow their ageing,” explains Barzilai, who’s working on identifying them. He’s already discovered some 60% have genes that lower their levels of growth hormones in late life. This all suggests that genes, rather than lifestyle, are the secret to becoming a centenarian. Not all species age like humans. Take ocean quahogs (a species of mollusc), rockfish andGreenland sharks, which don’t have an exponentially increased death rate with age. “Our knowledge of the mechanisms of ageing is incomplete,” says Faragher. A key driver of ageing is a process called cell senescence. Cells enter this toxic state as we age, damaging tissue and generating inflammation and disease. But Cox and colleagueshave shownthat you can slow ageing if you manipulate these cells to behave as if they were younger. In 2009, ahugely promising studyshowed the drug rapamycin could make mice live up to 14% longer. A clinical trial on humans has even shown that when elderly people were given a low dose of a rapamycin-like drug for eight weeks, itboosted their immune system, and led to a 50% reduction in infections for a year. Other promising, FDA-approved drugs that can extend the lifespan of animals and lead to greater health and reduced mortality in humans include diabetes medicines such asmetformin,canagliflozinanddapagliflozin. Barzilai, however, stresses that these drugs have only been shown to work in people over 50. If you’re young, or you combine several of these drugs, you may find they cause harm such as reduced muscle mass and testosterone. Similarly, rapamycin can “trigger diabetes, ulcers and prevent wound healing at high doses”, says Cox. Johnson, who takes rapamycin and metformin, acknowledges this. “Metformin has so many effects on the body”, he says. “It may have some kind of effect on muscle to some degree, but it may have a whole bunch of positive effects too.” Another option is to deal with senescent cells by deleting them. Compounds found in many fruits and vegetables, includingdasatinib,navitoclax,quercetinandfisetin, have shown promise in deleting such cells – and are now sold as supplements. Such drugs may also treatdiabetic kidney diseaseandidiopathic pulmonary fibrosisin humans, both caused in part by senescent cells. Faragher has also shown that resveratrol, found in grapes,can reverse cell senescence. But again, senescent cells do some good, too, such as healing wounds, which means it can be risky getting rid of them. We don’t know for sure whether these drugs or supplements will actually help humans live considerably longer. But many longevity enthusiasts including Johnson are already taking them. Faragher, however, doesn’t believe any of this will lead to an “immortality pill”. Rather, these kinds of drugs could be “a bit like antibiotics” – taken during a limited time when you’re ill or ahead of vaccination to enhance the immune system. More experimental techniques exist, but may cause cancer. These include “epigenetic reprogramming” of cells to make them younger and gene therapies aimed at lengthening our telomeres – protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age. But while short telomeres are linked to a short lifespan, long telomeres boost cancer risk. “I’m very hesitant about the telomerase stuff because of the cancer risk, though some newer studies suggest it’s possible to minimise that risk,” says Cox. So where does that leave us? Unfortunately, it appears to be a waiting game. Despite genuinely promising research, a lack of human trials means there’s still noprovenway to live significantly past 100. Researchers also warn against mixing and matching drugs and interventions the way Johnson does. “Each one might buy a little bit of extra time. But if you put them all together, you might do worse rather than better,” says Cox. But Johnson is optimistic. “I’ve arguably got the best biomarkers in the world,” he says, adding that scientists, who “are spending 75% of their time writing grant proposals”, should learn to value the open source data he provides – especially as other people are copying his protocol. Barzilai disagrees, stressing that one self-experimenting individual does not constitute a scientific study. “If Bryan Johnson dies, which I think is possible because he is doing a lot of crazy things together, it will reflect badly on us.”",

Some of the unique plants in this rainforest can trace their lineage back 40 or 50m years when the Gondwana supercontinent was breaking apart and Australia was detaching itself from what is now Antarctica.  Take only a few steps from the cool shade and you emerge to something altogether different. Still rainforest, but changing fast. Soil and rocks are exposed and, above, the leafless branches of tall and dead trees let the sunlight strike the forest floor. This is a place packed with threatened species, including the nightcap oak – a true Gondwanan relic that grows nowhere else. On the ground and at the base of the thin-barked trees is charcoal. Five years ago, chunks of this rainforest not evolved to burn, did burn, during what became known as Australia’s black summer bushfires. “It can take a lot of these trees a long time to die. It is a long, slow death,” says Dr Robert Kooyman, an evolutionary ecologist who has spent more than 40 years working and studying the rainforests in and around Nightcap national park in northernNew South Wales. About 73,000 sq km of forest were burned in the east and south of the country during black summer and the fires scorched the habitat of about3 billion native animals. Half of the world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests – a network of 40 parks and reserves – were affected by the fires that were driven by global heating. Fires burned into about 10% of the rainforest in the Nightcap area and affected about 30% of the rainforest’s margin, says Kooyman. Kooyman discovered the nightcap oak in the late 1980s. Unlike Australia’s many eucalypt species, rainforest trees have not evolved to deal with fire. “It burns around the base and it cooks the cambium layer – the live wood – and the bark. It triggers this slow-motion death and you can see the progressive stages here,” he says, pointing to trees in various stages of that slow death. The fires killed about a third of the mature nightcap oaks, he says, leaving 181 behind. Kooyman’s monitoring shows 72 of those are struggling to survive, or have lost their main stem and now persist “as suckers only”. “That one’s on the way out,” says Kooyman, pointing to a nightcap whose bark and stem is split and is covered by fungi. “That one is failing too,” says Kooyman, pointing to another. “And this was a low-intensity burn.” There is smoke in the air from a nearby hazard reduction burn on the day Kooyman takes us to the marked-out plots where he and colleagues are monitoring every post-fire breath, death and revival. Traps made from net and laundry baskets catch and record whatever falls from the canopy; straps called dendrometers measure trunk growth; and then there are recordings of temperature, humidity, light and seed generation, and the state of the soil. “They can shrink before they die,” says Kooyman, pointing to one of the dendrometers. “The theory of negative growth is real – that would drive the economists crazy,” he laughs. As we leave to look at another patch of burnt rainforest, Kooyman yanks a young wattle that’s sprouting. The fires removed the leaf litter on the forest floor, creating a perfect bed for dormant wattle seeds to germinate. They have been growing at an incredible density – as many as 30,000 a hectare (12,100 an acre). “They’ll create a fire influence inside the rainforest,” he says. “If we had a dry season and another fire, there are huge amounts of this vegetation that would explode in flames. That’s the problem. You end up with a fire-prone landscape.” The fires here were followed within months by torrential rain and violent floods that blasted the banks of the rock-strewn creeks and swept away weakened trees and plants. Kooyman used to see platypus here but since the fires, there’s no sign. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion More than once on this day, Kooyman bristles when the word “recovery” comes up. For fire-adapted forests, the word “recovery” might be fair, but not for rainforests, he says. “Let’s not let this terminology overwhelm us. This is not recovery,” he says, pointing to a 2ft-tall sucker growing from the base of a dead trunk. “What we have discovered is that even after almost five years, the trajectory is still in reverse. The impacts are accumulating and it hasn’t stabilised.” “Do we want these forests in the future? Do we log them? Do we have them crisped by climate change, or do we start compensating for what we know is happening and protect them?” The fire that hit Nightcap national park and the neighbouring Whian Whian state conservation area started in late October as a lightning strike and gained momentum as the extreme heat and dry of 2019 was joined by winds. Kooyman is an honorary research fellow at Sydney’s Macquarie University, a researcher at the city’s Royal Botanical Gardens and scientist with Missouri Botanical Gardens programs in west Africa and Madagascar. But he lives less than an hour’s drive from Nightcap and got to his beloved rainforest within days as the ground was still smouldering. “I did find myself, not depressed but, maybe like PTSD working in these impact zones. I’m not inclined to any level of depression, but this has had an impact on me. You catch yourself being a little angrier or shorter [tempered] than usual. “Having never lived through these sorts of events at those scales it takes some adjusting.” Kooyman is 71, but he moves like someone half his age. Several times this morning, he jumps from his four-wheel drive to chainsaw trees that have fallen across the track. “I’m feeling an urgency now and it’s not so much down to my sunset clause,” he says. In a break, he puts his laptop on the bonnet to show some images of his plots. They look like landscape ink drawings of the forest you might hang on your wall. But these delicate strokes are the artefacts of data from laser scans of the parts of the forest he’s been monitoring. The areas that escaped the fire have a dense and continuous canopy shrouding the understory. But the scans taken from areas that burned show a canopy that is barely a canopy at all. Technology is moving fast and Kooyman is excited that new approaches, like LiDAR scanning, could give him answers to questions he has been chasing his whole career. “We’re getting deeper insights into how these rainforest systems work. So I’m excited,” he says. “But the irony is we’re getting better at measuring decline.”",Graham Readfearn

Find your passion’: how Aldo Kane became TV’s go-to danger man | Exploration | The Guardian,,"There aren’t many people who could casually drop “When I was standing on the summit of Everest” into a conversation without it coming across as a massive flex. Somehow, though, Aldo Kane pulls it off in a manner that almost passes you by, as if it’s just – oh, you know – one of those things you do at work.Then again, maybe the reason he owns it so easily is that climbing Everest is probably one of the easier things he’s done. Kane, you see, is the go-to adventure safety guy for anyone in the TV business. So you might need to get a film crew into (and out of) an active volcano; or maybe there’s this remote uncharted river in New Guinea and a famous naturalist looking for help to get there. Or perhaps you’re James Cameron, the latestAvatarmovie has wrapped and you need safety provision for a documentary (someone to restrain the odd shark with his bare hands while keeping a bunch of marine biologists alive in the world’s most hostile watery environments). Kane is that guy: the explorer’s explorer.  For the past 14 years you’ve probably seen his work, if not the man himself, as he’s been the expert behind the scenes keeping the likes of Will Smith, Steve Backshall and Alex Honnold safe. Gradually, though, he’s gone from being glimpsed coiling ropes in the background to working in front of the camera. Now, in Cameron’s new exploration series,OceanXplorers, Kane takes a lead role onscreen. But being on TV has always been a byproduct. “I get people asking how they can get to do what I do. Everyone wants to be a YouTuber or on TV, but I’m like, it doesn’t start with fame. It starts with yourthing– and I say just find the thing, find your passion. It might be cross-stitch or basketball or teaching. Whatever motivates you, do it for that thing, not for fame.” The “thing” for Kane, 46, was always the outdoors and exploration, driven initially by his dad, a Scout leader in Kilwinning, Scotland, where he grew up, who would take him into the mountains around Glencoe. “From an early age I was always reading about people like Chris Bonington, but those climbers and explorers were a very specific type of person… I had a chip on my shoulder about not coming from that type of background. I came from a very working-class background where I didn’t know that stuff was even open to me.” It wasn’t about the money: “Anyone can raise money – it’s about confidence, not cash. I let that get in my way, got bitter about wanting to get out into the world and do some of this stuff.” His way of getting out into the world was to join the Royal Marines at 16. “What interested me was the autonomy. Being able to move around a battlefield alone and unseen, not because you want to kill someone, but because you want to be fully alone and self-sufficient in a hostile environment.” Kane spent 10 years in the marines as a sniper, deployed in Northern Ireland (“It wasn’t a spicy tour, it was during the peace process”), and also Iraq, whichwasspicy and was where he became “acutely aware how valuable life was. Losing mates or seeing how shit it can be when two countries fight, made me aware that time was as valuable – more valuable – than money.” But, for a man obsessed with autonomy, the military also meant there were too many other people in charge of how he got to use that precious time. “I wanted to make those decisions for myself. The best thing I ever did was join the marines; the second best was leave.” Now, though, it’s the 21st century and the kid from Scotland who was obsessed with Chris Bonington mountaineering books is living in a world where Google Street View will take you by the hand every step of the way to Everest base camp – I wonder, is there anything left to explore? We’re sitting in the house on the outskirts of Bristol where he lives with his wife, Anna Williamson (a TV producer who he met, appropriately enough, when they were filming on the slopes of an erupting volcano in 2015), two young sons and a dog, eager for attention – none more urban, you might say, but Kane doesn’t hesitate: “I could walk 300m out of our front door and there’s a council estate up there where I could climb a tree – and I could guarantee I’d be the first person to have climbed that tree.” The reference to Everest – which he climbed last year – is to make the point that there are thousands of unexplored peaks within sight of it: “If you want to explore, step off the track. Most people are doing the same thing, but if you take one step off the track – literally or metaphorically – you’re suddenly in a very small minority. There’s an absolute ton of unexplored places out there. And it’s now easier to get to them.” So, yes, maybe the big, obvious ones are gone – tired old Everest – but if you look at the ocean alone, 80% of it is still unexplored. Which brings us to Cameron andOceanXplorers, a six-part documentary series, which centres on the ship of the title, purpose-built to delve into that 80%. From the elusive Greenland shark, purported to live up to 500 years, to the changing habits of Svalbard’s polar bears, via the vertical migration of a jellyfish that’s like something out ofFinding Nemo, the series captures never-before-seen data and footage. There are moments where scientists with years of experience in their field are moved to tears by what they discover. I wonder, did Kane experience anything like that while filming? He thinks for a long moment and then says: “I’d been free-diving with humpback whales… and then I came up and watched our son, Atlas, being born on a WhatsApp call from the boat. Then, the next thing, I’m back with the humpbacks, watching the a calf being nursed by its mother. I was, like, that’s weird, that’s exactly what Atlas is doing right now. It was a moment of connection. We’re not separate from all this, we’re part of it: there’s a commonality with all mammals and us.” And that’s the common thread throughout the series: our connection with nature. Despite all the tech – the mini-subs, drones and virtual reality labs – that connection crops up everywhere, whether it’s scientists getting emotional over film footage or the moment a distraught polar bear expert from the Norwegian Polar Institute finds the remains of a bear he has been studying for nine years – dead from starvation due to climate change. And also because, sometimes, you just need a man in the water with a giant fish or fishes – never mind the tech, just get out there andfeel. And that’s where Kane came in, because Cameron still needed someone to lean out of a flimsy boat to restrain a 4m shark as it was tagged. Or to dive in 5,000m of inky black sea at midnight with a camera operator, while tens of thousands of poisonous jellyfish migrate from the depths to feed. “This term adventurer has come out in the last few years and that’s what I get called. But in whatever I do, I’m essentially a facilitator. I use a unique set of skills and experiences to help other people do a thing,” he says. “But I’m not special, there’s probably 5,000 marines in the UK at any one time and we all have the same training.” Special or not, it must have been a tough journey from the marines to working with an Oscar-winning director on his passion project – one that didn’t happen overnight. He laughs: “Yeah, I left the marines and swiftly discovered how little outdoor instructors are paid! I had to find a way to make money and still do the things I loved.” The answer was oil rigs: industrial abseiling to test the integrity of their steel structure. Two weeks on, two weeks off, when he’d go adventuring. For four years in his mid-20s he did this until he got a call from a friend who ran a safety company for TV, asking if he wanted to help get a film crew into a volcano in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “I was like: yes!” Also on that trip was a French guide whose other job was to look after photographer Sebastião Salgado – getting him safely in and out of places to take his photos. “I was, like, so wait a minute –that’s a job?” Kane came back from the DRC a changed man: “I realised there’s this whole industry of people who do stuff to make TV work. So I doubled down, looked at what was coming around the corner in the adventure world and got trained up in all of it between working on the rigs.” The work began to come in: rigging ropes in Salisbury Cathedral spire so thatBlue Petercould change a lightbulb, or accompanying Tom Hardy, Henry Cavill and Adrien Brody on an extreme road trip. In between, though, he was cleaning wind turbines inside and out (“The grease from the gears drips down inside, someone has to go in, abseil down and wipe it off.”) But, around this time, adventure-TV producers were beginning to realise that letting audiences in on their secrets could make for good entertainment. “Viewers are not stupid, they know that for every presenter doing the hero stuff on camera, there’s a guy out of sight running backwards making it happen. It made sense to start showing them. I got in at the right time when they started letting people like me on camera.” Steve Backshall was his big break. The naturalist and explorer was heading to Venezuela to climb a rock wall in the jungle and chose Kane as his safety adviser. “What we got was not in the brochure,” Backshall tells me. “Nasty, crumbling, slick rock, with horrific rockfalls and electric storms that threatened to sweep us off the cliffs. Aldo was always the last one working, the last to bed, the first up and cooking brekkie… I have a lucid memory of him bedding down for the night curled up on top of a pile of rocks, never moaning for an instant. He’s multiskilled, cool under fire and strong in a crisis but, above all, the reason he’s the first on any expedition team sheet is that he’s just great company.” This was also the first time Kane was on camera: “It was one of the best things I ever did. Steve and I, plus a small film crew. That was the changeover. Nothing changed in the job I was doing, except there was a camera pointing at me.” But whathaschanged, I point out, is that he’s now a dad. What’s that done to his perception of risk? “Nothing, because I’ve always been on the conservative side. I’ve never done anything that’s blatantly 50/50 where I may or may not live. People think you’re an adrenaline junkie with zero control, but the reason I do it is all about control.” Then he adds: “What has changed is an awareness of what could happen environmentally in the next 30 to 40 years. When you go to a place and there’s only 20 animals left, does that mean when my son’s 20 they’ll all be gone? So, for the last few years, I’ve looked for everything I’ve worked on to have a bigger purpose outside of the adventure itself.” The over-arching thing withOceanXplorers, he’s keen to point out, is that there was real science going on. “They were writing real papers. And there was a sense of purpose, being of use. I’ve worked with so many scientists, but if their work doesn’t get out to the masses, then it gets lost – and then who cares if this animal goes extinct? “You need people explaining it all, because if you tell a story compassionately enough, you can make a huge difference. And the reason I’ve had such a long run is that I can do lots of things to a good standard to help those stories get out there. But I’m under no illusion that all this being on camera stuff is going to stop at some point.” Somehow, though, I doubt it. Given the threats to our natural environment, it’s likely that Kane’s services are going to be needed for a while yet. But even if the work does dry up, there will always be plenty of trees to climb.

An area of outstanding natural beauty, it has been favoured by the royal family for centuries, including Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria. But the water at Colwall is now in the spotlight for very different reasons. The most recent data fromSevern Trent Water, the company that covers the area, reveals that a sewage treatment works on Cradley Brook, near the village, spilled sewage for 1,756 hours in 2021 and 1,361 hours in 2022.  An analysis by the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution suggests some of these spills may be in breach of the water firm’s environmental permits. Its analysis suggests there were 72 unlawful spills in 2021 and 2022.Severn Trentsaid this weekend the “desktop” analysis was based on certain assumptions, and insisted the works were operating in line with permit conditions. Chris Blake, a member of the Colwall Orchard Group, a volunteer group that grows apples for the community, says that nature was a formative part of his childhood in Herefordshire, and worries it is now being tainted by pollution. “I remember playing in the shallows: you could look into the water, it was crystal clear and you could see the weeds streaming away down the river,” he said. But the beauty he enjoyed as a child, both in the smaller brooks and larger rivers, has since been lost, he said. “The water doesn’t look wonderful. We would look across the rapids where the salmon fishermen were. Now there’s no fishermen because there’s no salmon.” In April, a blockage in a pipe at Colwall led to sewage streaming into the roads and fields, with the discharges up to a foot deep in some places. Severn Trent said a third party had put plastic balls into the sewer, causing the spill. A major concern among Colwall’s residents is the inability of the current sewage treatment plant – already struggling to deal with the village’s population – to cope with a planned new housing development that was voted against by about 92% of residents. It was given planning permission earlier this year. Paul Evans, a local resident, has been lobbying the local council for years to investigate the Severn Trent sewage infrastructure and whether it is adequate for a growing population. In a submission to the local council in opposition to the development of 36 new homes, he wrote: “We know that [the sewage treatment works] is already dumping raw sewage into Cradley Brook on a regular basis and Old Colwall was left ankle deep in sewage earlier this year because of a pipeline failure. Does anyone believe it is right to permit this development to exacerbate these problems?” Severn Trent was awarded the top four-star rating in its most recent annual environmental performance assessment by the Environment Agency. The firm achieved the highest rating despite paying a£2m fine in February for “reckless” pollution of the River Trent. after newsletter promotion A Severn Trent spokesperson said: “The treatment works is operating normally in line with all its permits. The storm overflow is affected by increased rainfall but due to local interventions, spill numbers are being actively reduced.” Helen Heathfield, a councillor at Herefordshire council, regularly tests water in Cradley Brook. She says the tests have found “worrying” levels of phosphate, with contributing factors including agricultural run-off and sewage discharges. She said that the nationalisation of water companies is the only way to guarantee that the quality of local water is held accountable by the people who drink it. “Colwall is a really beautiful, lovely place and the people who live there are very lucky – it’s heartbreaking that we’re letting this happen.”",Raphael Boyd

While the audience for Rogan’s health advice and anti-woke politics skews heavily male, Cooper’s podcast of girls’ room secrets, dating stories and therapy-like disclosures is listened to by young, sex-positive women. Cooper, who turned 30 this year,invites guests such as Katy Perry, Heidi Klum and Miley Cyrus to dress down (most appear on the podcast clad in sweatsuits and baseball caps) and share intimate details of their sexual and psychological lives. Cooper’s honesty is wildly popular and profitable; in 2021, she inked a $60m deal with Spotify, one of the biggest ever for a podcast at the time. In August, she signed a new dealworth more than doublethat, leaving Spotify for a $125m three-year offer from the US radio company SiriusXM.  The big money hasn’t dulled the sexual content. A recent sampling of episode titles reads like 1970s Cosmopolitan cover lines: Narcissists, Blow Jobs, and Red Flags; Getting Older, Hotter, and Wiser; and I Made Out with My Boyfriend’s Mistress. So regular listeners may have been to surprised to hearKamala Harrissit down opposite Cooper on the podcast this week, not least because Cooper herself had promised not to sully her sex-positive show with staged political appearances. In February, she told theNew York Timesshe had shut down conversations with the White House. “Go on CNN, go on Fox,” she said at the time. “You want to talk about your sex life, Joe [Biden]?” Weeks before the election, Cooper has had a change of heart. “At the end of the day, I couldn’t see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I’m not a part of it,” she explained on air, reflecting how central she sees herself to female pop culture in the US. For Harris, the decision to go on such an explicit podcast might seem risque, but politically it makes perfect sense. Not only does Call Her Daddy have huge reach among young women, but because Cooper has kept politics away from her public image, experts suspect that her audience might be a well of untapped, undecided voters, too. “Everyone I know has at least tuned into a Call Her Daddy episode,” said Jessica Siles, the deputy press secretary of the gen Z-led non-profit Voters of Tomorrow. “It’s not a news show; it’s a lifestyle podcast, and those are the exact sort of people who need Harris’s message more than others. She’s reaching an audience that she hasn’t met before, who might align with her on some of the issues, but need a little bit of a push to turn out.” The show had a different tone from previous episodes. Harris didn’t get any questions about sex positions or bachelorette parties. Instead the conversation mainly focused on reproductive health, women’s rights and the vice-president’s family life. Though Cooper switched out her trademark sweatpants for what can best be described as gen Z business casual (black stiletto boots, black wide leg jeans, and a hooded sweatshirt branded with “Unwell”, the name of her media company), the interview still read as comfy, with Harris fielding mostly safe questions. The standout moment came when Harris shot back at Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ recent comments about Harris’s lack of biological children. (The Arkansas governor said: “My kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble.”) “I don’t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble. Two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life, and children in their life.” But it wasn’t all stump speech. Harris chatted about being friends with Kerstin Emhoff, her husband Doug’s ex-wife and mother to Harris’s stepchildren, Ella and Cole: “Family comes in many forms … This is not the 1950s any more.” Cooper opened the episode with a disclaimer, suggesting her interview was not necessarily an endorsement of Harris: “I am so aware I have a very mixed audience when it comes to politics,” she said. “So please hear me when I say my goal today is not to change your political affiliation.” But Cooper does come with political baggage. A former ad sales representative, she started Call Her Daddy with her roommate, Sofia Franklyn, in 2018, as a forum for what theydubbed“female locker room talk”. The podcast was quickly picked up by Barstool Sports, a media company known for its blog covering sports, pop culture and viral moments. Barstool’s owner, Dave Portnoy, is an archetypical frat boy with a history of making misogynistic and racist remarks. The journalist Matthew Walther coined the term “Barstool conservatism” to describe the political leanings of the young men who read Barstool and hold libertarian, but socially conservative, views. When faced with accusations of misogyny and toxic workplace practices, Portnoy held up Call Her Daddy as a marquee name and proof the company wasn’t only appealing to young misogynist men. “I gave two girls their own radio show. We have hired girl after girl – they say it’s a great place to work,”he saidat the time. But that love didn’t last: in the summer of 2020, Call Her Daddy went dark. After weeks of silence, Portnoy said the hosts and Barstool were involved in a contract dispute, with Cooper agreeing to go on with Barstool but Franklyn unwilling to agree to the terms. Hecalledthe hosts “unprofessional, disloyal, and greedy” and said Barstool lost $100,000 with every missed episode. This fracture ultimately caused a split between the hosts, and Cooper continued without Franklyn. Cooperparted with Barstoola year later, when the Spotify deal came through. Messiness aside, Cooper’s initial association with Portnoy might explain why, even if she has socially liberal values, she remains associated with a type of fratty, more conservative listener – the kinds of girls who might date guys who read Barstool and maybe even vote for Donald Trump. Sign up toThe Stakes — US Election Edition The Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential election after newsletter promotion Jeri Steinmetz and Ciara Parsons are cousins who host a rival comedic conversation podcast, Ladies & Tangents. (Tagline: “Think sleepover but we all have mental health disorders.”) The pair say many lifestyle podcasters start out non-partisan to avoid controversy, but it’s tough to stay that way in a hyper-political world. “We’re women, mothers, and these issues directly affect us and our fans. So we did start speaking out, and I think that’s what happened here with Call Her Daddy,” Steinmetz said. Cooper, who declined a request for comment, seemed to expect backlash to the episode, and got it from all sides. Some listeners wished she would stay out of politics. Others wanted her to be tougher on Harris. Some questioned the optics of Harris doing the interview so soon after the devastation of Hurricane Helene. “So cool! Kamala sits down for a podcast as a fourth of the country is underwater,” one Instagram user wrote in a comment on the podcast’s page. “She can’t hold a press conference but can go on podcasts lol,” said another. Newsweekreported that the show and Cooper herself lost “thousands” of Instagram followers after the episode dropped. ButCooper’s reach remains phenomenal as traditional news outlets hemorrhage audiences, and she’s become an avatar for a generation that’s more likely to learn about headlines through a TikTok or Instagram reel. Varietyreportedthat musicians who appear on her show see a boost on music streaming apps – even ones who are celebrities on their own, such as John Mayer (who saw streams jump by 350%) and John Legend (200%).Voguegave lavish coverage to Cooper’s “intimate beachside wedding” to the producer Matt Kaplan, which took place on Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula. Though Call Her Daddy has matured in recent years, becoming as much about mental health as it is about masturbation, it’s been tough for Cooper to shake her reputation of, as the New York Times put it, “an evangelist of feminine raunch”. She’s become so synonymous with the world of women’s media that Netflix’s new romantic comedy series Nobody Wants This name-drops her as a rival to its main character, a blonde sex-podcast host played by Kristen Bell. Harris is not the first candidate to use a buzzy entertainment show to try to reach younger voters. Barack Obama wooed millennials by appearing on Zach Galifianakis’s YouTube show and Bill Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show. But Rebeca Damico, a 21-year-old public relations specialist and avid Call Her Daddy Fan from Salt Lake City, says this was a more revealing encounter. She felt she learned more about Harris through this interview than in last month’s presidential debate. “I watched the debate, and it was way more comical than informational,” she said. “Call Her Daddy did a good job at humanizing Harris, and it was cool to see her not even as a politician, but as a woman.” In the spirit of fairness, Cooper said she had invited Trump on the show to counter Harris’s points. He has yet to respond. “That would be such a fascinating episode,” said Siles, the Voters of Tomorrow press secretary. “To be honest, I’m not sure I believe Donald Trump knows what a pap smear is. So to go on a show about women’s issues would be entertaining, at least.”",Alaina Demopoulos

In the 1930s he founded theWeek, which exposed Nazi sympathisers in Britain, and interviewed Al Capone for theTimes. Now the remarkable life of Claud Cockburn, who died in 1981, is being told by his son, Patrick, in a book which hails him as the inventor of “guerrilla journalism”. Having been a rising star at theTimesin the 1920s and early 1930s as a correspondent in Berlin and New York, Cockburn, the son of a British diplomat, foresaw what was happening in Germany as Hitler and the Nazis advanced and decided that the best way to combat this was through a newsletter – theWeek. This would both publicise what was happening in Germany and entertain his readers with political gossip and insight. An article on what he would call the “Cliveden set”, about those in Britain who sought to appease Hitler, alerted people to what was happening in a way the mainstream press did not. The then German ambassador to Britain, Joachim von Ribbentrop – later to be executed at Nuremberg – complained angrily about the coverage.  In 1933, Ramsay MacDonald, whose plans to end the great depression by calling a world economic conference in London were mocked by Cockburn, was so enraged that he called an impromptu press conference to denounce him, holding up a copy of theWeek. This propelled its name and reputation around the world. What prompted the book now, more than 40 years after Claud’s death? “A few years ago I applied to MI5 for his files and about a year later I got 24 volumes of them,” said Patrick Cockburn, himself an award-winning correspondent for thei, theIndependentand theFinancial Times. “I had always wondered how effective theWeekwas and that kind of journalism he also did later, in the 1950s, forPunchand in the 1960s forPrivate Eye. “What I learned from the files was that it had had an enormous impact. There were splenetic memos from senior officials, outraged at his disclosures and speculation about his sources and how he seemed to know exactly what had happened in a cabinet meeting two days earlier. There was some of this stuff in his 1967 autobiography [I, Claud...] but an awful lot he hadn’t written about.” The cast of characters Cockburn engaged with over the years is striking. In 1930, he went to Chicago for theTimesto interview Capone, who gave him a lecture on the virtues of American capitalism. The writer Christopher Isherwood was a fan. “I find myself warming to Cockburn,” he wrote in 1934. “I get theWeekregularly… he does slash out at these crooks and murderers and he’s so inexhaustibly cocky and funny, like a street-boy throwing stones at pompous windows.” At lunch with Charles de Gaulle in Algiers in 1943, the general asked Cockburn why he was a communist. After listening to his response, de Gaulle asked: “Don’t you think your view is somewhat romantic?” Cockburn had joined the Communist party in the 1930s and wrote for theDaily Worker(now theMorning Star). He covered the Spanish civil war for the paper and, as Patrick Cockburn puts it, “he thought the communists alone had the fanaticism and discipline to give the republic a fighting chance against General Franco”. Reporting alongside him was the redoubtable Jean Ross, the second of his three partners, who was covering the war for theDaily Expressand would file copy under Cockburn’s name for theDaily Workerwhen he was at the front. Isherwood based Sally Bowles inGoodbye to Berlinon Ross. In Spain, he not only fought with the republican militia but engaged in an elaborate hoax to help it. Field guns for the republican military were being held at the French-Spanish frontier but Cockburn and his friend Otto Katz felt that if the French prime minister Léon Blum was to learn of a mutiny against Franco in Spanish Morocco he might let the guns through. A bogus story about the “mutiny” duly appeared and might well have led to Blum relaxing the border controls. When Cockburn told the story of the fake uprising a couple of decades later, it “did him reputational damage”, as Patrick Cockburn puts it, but his father was unrepentant. “I felt that Claud’s derisive but unwavering suspicion of governments and the mainline media, always expecting the worst from both, was the correct posture for a polemical journalist,” wrote Patrick in the introduction. “He disbelieved strongly in the axiom about telling ‘truth to power’, knowing that the rulers of the Earth have no wish to hear any such thing. Much more effective, he believed, is to tell truth to the powerless strongly, so they have a fighting chance in any struggle against the big battalions.” Discover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories. Literary delights delivered direct to you after newsletter promotion Was Patrick Cockburn surprised by what he discovered in his research? “Claud was a much tougher and more practical man than I’d pictured him growing up. He thought very carefully about how a single journalist, without resources, could influence events and how could a non-professional army win a war. A further reason for me deciding to write the book was is that, over the years reporting crises and wars, I came to feel that Claud’s scepticism about the competence and good intentions of governments and powerful organisations in general was fully justified – something glaringly true today.” Claud Cockburn’s three sons all became journalists: Alexander, who died in 2012, moved to the US and wrote forVillage Voice, theNationandCounterPunch; Andrew is the Washington editor ofHarper’sand I have known them all. With the growth of the far right in Europe, and conflicts across the world, Patrick Cockburn said his father’s work was particularly relevant. “These crises that turn into wars and governments increasingly having to cover things up means that dissident journalism is still relevant. It’s as important now as it was in the 1930s. David can still do serious damage to Goliath, when you could wage an information guerrilla war against the powers that be.”",Duncan Campbell

Ellie the Elephant is no brightly colored blob tripping down a court at half-time. She is a dancing phenom – splits and worms and handstands, oh my! – as well as a physical comic genius. Her firecracker energy is synonymous with the rise of a Liberty team that has become the obsession of countless women across the city during their run to the WNBA finals, where they are on the doorstep of becoming the first New York basketball franchise to win a championship in over 50 years. “Ellie is iconic,” said Claire Abelson, 26, a teacher and Liberty diehard. “She exemplifies Brooklyn and Black excellence.” Martha Nadell, a fiftysomething English professor, was never a big fan of basketball, but now has season tickets. She gets a kick out of watching Ellie hype up the crowd with her just-short-of-dirty dancing while her ever-present handlers stand by, guarding the superstar’s handbag of the day. (Ellie has a vast collection.) “How can you not love a twerking elephant?” said Nadell.

Never missing are the Statue of Liberty-inspired tiara, the lengthy tail and the 72-inch braid that she whips around to alternately fierce and coquettish effect.

Ellie, who is all of four years old, owes a great debt to Shana Stephenson, the Liberty’s chief brand officer. Working with the team’s chief executive, Keia Clarke, Stephenson conceptualized the mascot when the team moved from Madison Square Garden across the East River to the $1bn Barclays Center andMaddie, the golden retriever mascot named after the previous home arena, had to be put down. So Stephenson enlisted a slew of artists to propose sketches for an outer-borough mascot who was an elephant, a tribute to PT Barnum’s great elephant parade across the Brooklyn Bridge in 1884. Criscia Long, the Liberty’s senior director of entertainment who helps coordinate Ellie’s game-day performances, rounded off the all-Black creative team behind what soon would become the most talked-about mascot in professional sports. It was essential that Ellie embody Brooklyn and, given that she was representing a WNBA team, that she be an ur-woman (fur woman?). “We really wanted Ellie to be feminine,” said Stephenson, who was part of a group of Liberty executives who took to social media and reached out to casting directors to hold auditions, then met with a gamut of local performers who shared their interpretations of what Ellie could be. “We didn’t really share that much information about Ellie, we really wanted them as creatives, as entertainers, as performers, to help us define what a New York Liberty mascot could represent,” she added. “We wanted someone who could dance and entertain and if they had athleticism, that would be fantastic, but it wasn’t necessary.” That Ellie not feel like a ripoff of other mascots was key. “Some mascots can be dopey or goofy or kind of clumsy,” said Stephenson. “Ellie is sassy. Ellie is friendly. Ellie is entertaining. She’s full of attitude, she’s multi-faceted, and she’s stylish. I would describe Ellie as a fashionista and an athlete and a dancer. She’sthatgirl.” Just who that handbag-toting girl is, though, remains a tightly guarded secret. Team officials will not disclose Ellie’s true identity – and insist that the players don’t know either. They will share that Ellie is always played by the same human. A true artist, the mystery performer collaborates on all dimensions of her persona and shenanigans. “Ellie definitely has input on how she shows up,” said Stephenson. “And I love that about Ellie, because she’s not someone that we just dictate to and say: You’re going to wear this or you need to dance to this song. She’s very much involved in the vision.” Part of that vision includes involving fans of all ages. “Regardless of if you’re a little girl or 45-year-old woman, Ellie is able to connect with you,” said Stephenson. “Our players are so nice and approachable and accessible. And I think that that’s really what makes our team unique. And I think something that makes Ellie special is she has a sense of humor.” Ellie worked her magic throughout last month’s semi-final opener, eliciting a chorus of “I love you, Ellie!” from a gaggle of women seated in a private box. When Slick Rick came onto the court at half-time to perform his 80s hit Mona Lisa, the flirtatious fashionista was dancing like nobody’s business. When the players returned to the court for the third quarter, Ellie was far from done pumping up the crowd. She strutted from seat to seat and flipped her braid for astar-flecked crowdthat included Spike Lee, Jason Sudeikis, Tracy Morgan and celebrity chef Kwame Onwuachi. “She amps up the energy,” said Dana Nathanson, a 27-year-old Brooklynite and hardcore Liberty fan. “All throughout the game she is running up and down the arena, dancing to Missy Elliott, and she’ll have eight outfit changes.” Aria McManus, a 35-year-old artist and basketball obsessive who runs Downtown Girls, a pickup league for women and nonbinary people, credits Ellie with the Liberty fever that has swept her cohort. “When the Liberty first came to Barclays, there weren’t enough ticket sales so they covered the top seats with a black curtain,” she said. “The games are so fun. It’s very wholesome and spirited and there are so many women and so many little girls. Something about watching Ellie do the splits keeps the energy up – even if they’re losing.” That hasn’t been a common occurrence for the Liberty of late. Aftercoming up two wins short of the titlelast October, New York coasted to the WNBA’s best regular-season record to earn the top seed in this year’s playoffs, where they breezed past the the Atlanta Dream and dethronedthe two-time defending champion Acesto book a return trip to the finals against the Minnesota Lynx, which tipped off on Thursday night in Brooklyn. It’s a national platform that Ellie will no doubt make her personal Met Gala – sherolled up to Game 1wearing a custom puffer with Timbs and a Telfar – as the Liberty look to become the first men’s or women’s basketball team from New York to raise a banner since the NBA’s Knicks back in 1973. Though nobody can say for sure who Ellie is, many of her fans regard her as a queer Black icon. (Theoccasional voiceoveron Ellie’s TikTok and Instagram accounts is reminiscent of Wanda Sykes.) “My friend who had season tickets got close to Ellie and screamed out to her: ‘Are you gay?’” said Agnes Walden, a 29-year-old artist who lives in Brooklyn. “And Ellie turned to her and made the rainbow symbol with her hands.”",Lauren Mechling

The first was theblast that devastated Beiruton 4 August 2020, when a vast store of ammonium nitrate exploded in the city, killing more than 200 people and injuring 7,000. The second was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has left hundreds of thousands of casualties have been inflicted since war erupted there in February 2022.  “Both the Beirut blast and the battles in Ukraine have caused thousands of dreadful extremity wounds and crush injuries in people who would lose legs and arms without urgent medical technological intervention,” said Anthony Bull, a professor of musculoskeletal mechanics atImperial College London. “In the past, providing that costly, complex intervention – during conflict or in the wake of natural catastrophes – has been a major problem, however.” Prof Bull and his colleague Dr Mehdi Saeidi began a collaboration in 2016 that aimed to take a radical new approach to the problem – by finding simple ways of making complex medical devices to help those with catastrophic injuries caused by natural disasters or warfare. Instead of relying on devices flown in from developed nations, toolkits and manuals could be developed and distributed to local people so they could make their own devices in garages or factories using conventional equipment. “We concentrated on devices known as external fixators,” Saeidi told theObserver. “These are used when a gunshot or a mine explosion or a collapsed building severs a person’s leg or arm bones. By holding pieces of shattered bone together, the injured person’s deep flesh wounds get a chance to recover and their limbs can be saved. “Crucially, this is not done by inserting a metal rod into a limb as this could trigger serious ­infections. Instead, it is held outside and is attached to the bone through pins that are pushed through a person’s arm or leg.” However, external ­fixators are complex and expensive. A single device can cost more than £2,000 and in conflict zones they are difficult to access. Sometimes homemade fixators are made but they often lead to serious complications. To get round this problem, Bull and Saeidi launched their project along with ­colleagues at Imperial and other international institutions, with funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Research and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. “We designed simple ways to make external fixators and tested them in Sri Lanka,” said Bull. “It was looking good. Then the Beirut explosion happened and there was an immediate call for hundreds of fixators to be sent there. We were not ready to help at this stage. Fortunately, other countries were able to step in and eventually send ­supplies. Nevertheless, it hit home that our ­initial idea had been the right one.” Since then, Bull and Saeidi have developed sets of instructions that can be used to manufacture fixators with limited skills and resources. “All that is needed is a supply of aluminium and some stainless steel rods,” said Saeidi. “It is very straightforward.” after newsletter promotion The value of this work was revealed in February 2022. After Russian troops poured across the border intoUkraine, hundreds of people suffered catastrophic injuries and faced losing limbs without fixators to save their arms and legs. “We got an urgent call from local doctors who were desperate for help and we were able to point them to our website, which had instructions on how to make fixators,” said Bull. “A couple of days later, a workshop in eastern Poland sent us a photo of a fixator they had just made from our instruction kit. In the first few days of the war, 150 of them were deployed and will have helped prevent injured people from losing legs or arms.” Since then, Saeidi has created a tool kit for making ­fixators and these are being tested in Kenya and Rwanda with the aim of perfecting a technology that is ready for use anywhere in the wake of earthquakes or wars. “When you get events like Beirut or Ukraine you get a sudden surge in terrible injuries,” said Bull. “We need simple ways to help doctors in these circumstances and that is what our fixator kits should do.”",Robin McKie

Challenger Deep, at the southern end of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, is 10.9km (6.8 miles) below sea level – deeper than Mount Everest (8.8km [5.5 miles]) is tall. Wright’s summer 2022 descent is documented in a new book,Mapping the Deep, written with her input. The dive was undertaken in a two-person submersible called Limiting Factor owned (since sold) byCaladan Oceanic, an ocean expedition company founded by investor turned deep sea explorerVictor Vescovo, who was also the craft’s pilot. Wright, 63, who also goes by the moniker “Deepsea Dawn”, is the chief scientist of Esri, a multinational that makes geographic information system (GIS) software for mapping and spatial analytics. Sending people to the deep ocean can be dangerous because of the extreme underwater pressure.Last year,OceanGate’sTitan submersible implodedon a journey to view the wreck of theTitanic, killing allfivepassengers on board. Why not just leave it to robots?Most of the exploration in the ocean is done by robots – it’s just more efficient, especially for mapping. But occasionally, it is important for a human to go down. It can betheway to get the best understanding of how a particular part of the Earth is working or solve a scientific mystery. In the case of Challenger Deep it is an iconic place and we had a scientific mission.  OceanGatedidn’t take proper safety precautions. The sub wasn’t certified, and the hull was cylindrical and made of carbon fibre. The sub I went down in had a hull machined to be as close to perfectly spherical as possible – it is the geometry that protects you from hydrostatic pressure – and it was made of titanium – the strongest material for the purpose. It was also certified: I wouldn’t have gone otherwise. What was the scientific point of your trip?Challenger Deep is made up of three depressions and my dive was to the least visited, Western Pool. We were the first to set eyes on some of the ground we covered. On the engineering side, it was to test a prototype instrument: a portable sidescan sonar specifically designed to withstand pressure and work at any ocean depth. Then we undertook multibeam sonar mapping from the support ship to give us a fresh map of the entirety of Challenger Deep and the Mariana Trench. That data has been deposited withSeabed 2030, a global collaborative effort to completely map the seabed by 2030 which Esri is part of. What was the dive like and what did you see?It was about a 10-hour round trip with two-and-a-half hours at the bottom to observe and test the prototype instrument, which we did over an area of a few hundred square metres. The spherical cockpit is a tight space and Victor and I sat with everything that we needed within reach. There is no toilet, so I had to safely dehydrate before the dive. At around 1,000m you get into complete darkness. Through the sub’s portholes, we saw bioluminescent jellyfish and worm-like siphonophores, which flashed back at us when Victor flashed the sub’s lights on them. The first moments of reaching the bottom were disheartening – we saw a beer bottle – but the rest was wonderful. We observed vast fields of boulders: evidence of the two tectonic plates that are colliding in that zone (the old, heavy Pacific Plate is diving underneath the Philippine Sea Plate). And we saw tiny creatures such as anemones, sea cucumbers and amphipods [a type of crustacean] – all withstanding huge pressure and functioning in complete darkness and cold. Our images and samples are being studied by marine biologists. Your career includesover 20 ship-basedresearch expeditions anddives in other submersibles. You have also pioneered the application of GIS to seafloor and ocean mapping. What got you interested in ocean science?I grew up in the Hawaiian islands and I was always at the beach. But I became fascinated by the geology too: living somewhere that started off as volcanoes under the sea and then rose. Combine that with watching Jacques Cousteau on TV and reading ocean adventure books and I made the decision at age eight to become an oceanographer. My first submersible dive was in 1991 in a research vessel called Alvin. It was to make observations of the geology and biology and map the distribution of hydrothermal vents (undersea hot springs) in a segment of the East Pacific Rise, the seafloor spreading zone in the Pacific Ocean. It was one of the first studies applying GIS to seabed mapping anywhere. You can get lost in a map of the ocean floor. One of your bugbears is that so little of the seafloor has been mapped to date in high resolution. Is it reallythatbad?Yes! Our current collective estimate is that we have 26.1% of the ocean mapped to the modern detail that we need. That’s a lot we don’t know about our home, given about 70% of our planet is ocean. The longer it takes for us to mapallthe seabed in detail, the more we play with fire: it is vital for so many things. For example, it gives us a better understanding of ocean volume, enabling climate scientists to build better models of climate change, improves our predictions of how tsunamis will behave and enables the design of protected marine habitats. Interest is growing indeep-sea mining. The International Seabed Authority plans to release regulations on the practice next year whileNorwayispressingaheadwith opening its own waters. Can deep-sea mining be done sustainably? Won’t better mapping of the seafloor aid mining companies to pursue extraction?The Seabed 2030 data is unlikely to be fine-grained enough for a mining operation. But the project’s data is open: anyone can use it. If mining companies are doing their own mapping of the seafloor, my hope is they would be willing to contribute it to Seabed 2030 to speed up ocean mapping and benefit us all. At this point, I don’t think it is possible to do it sustainably. The environmental assessments aren’t done and many of us don’t trust that they will be done properly. I have, in my personal capacity, signed astatement from marine expertscalling for a moratorium while potential impacts to the ocean environment are studied. I worry it would be massively damaging to large parts of the seafloor which are habitats to all sorts of biota. What would you like young women of colour who want a career in ocean science to know?That this type of work is for them too! And that there areorganisations that supportBlack marine scientists that weren’t there when I was coming along. All young people should pursue what they love and not let others divert them from that path. I was told once I was not cut out to be an oceanographer: I’m glad I didn’t follow that advice.

Charles and Queen Camilla will arrive in Australia on 18 October, with stops in Sydney and Canberra during their six-day visit.  The conversation about Australia’s future under the British monarchy has reared its head in light of the visit after a letter from King Charles to the Australian Republic Movement (ARM)was publicly reported this week. In the letter, Charles indicated he would not stand in the way if Australia wished to become a republic. The letter was in response to one sent by the ARM in December 2023, requesting a meeting with the King during his proposed visit to discuss Australia’s future relationship with the UK, and asking him to “consider publicly supporting the will of the Australian people and their desires to move to a republic”. In the reply, which was sent in March, Nathan Ross, assistant private secretary to the King, thanked the group for its “thoughtfulness in writing as you did” and reiterated the King and Queen’s “love and affection for Australia and Australians”. “The King appreciated that you took the time to write and asked me to reply on his behalf,” wrote Ross in the letter, seen by the Guardian. “Please be assured that your views on this matter have been noted very carefully. His Majesty, as a constitutional Monarch, acts on the advice of his Ministers, and whether Australia becomes a republic is, therefore, a matter for the Australian public to decide.” Australiaheld a referendum in 1999on the issue of becoming a republic, in which 54.9% of the country voted against. Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has previously voiced strong support for the country becoming a republic, saying: “Australia should have an Australian as our head of state.” When he took power in 2022,he appointed one of his MPs as assistant minister for the republic, signalling his intent to move towards another referendum. However, Albanese recently indicated that a second referendum was not a priority, and the assistant ministrywas abolished in July. Nathan Hansford, co-chair of ARM, said while the group had thought it was “quite unlikely” the King would agree to their request to support their cause – thereby eliminating himself as head of state in Australia – they wanted to have a respectful conversation about Australia’s future. “It’s up to Australia to decide what they want to do with the head of state. And what better time for us to have a think about that then when the King is here this week.” Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Hansford said according to research conducted by the group, 8% of Australians are “rusted-on monarchists”, 60% of Australians preferred an Australian as head of state and 40% of Australians didn’t even realise that Charles was the country’s head of state. “So we’re hoping that there’s a real conversation-starter, by Charles and Camilla coming here,” he said. “We’re a really unique country, we’re a country with such a long history – tens of thousands of years of Indigenous culture – and with a really multicultural community that’s been growing so much since we had the last referendum in 1999 … and most of us can’t really understand having our head of state as someone who’s born into the role and not selected on their merit. “People are really starting to think: well, is this who we are in 2024 as as a country?” Philip Benwell, national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, said the current system has served Australia well. “Our constitution provides stability and security,” he said. “There’s never been a major crisis with our constitution since 1901 [when Australia federated] … That’s what we are campaigning against, not for the sake of the King or, earlier, the Queen, but because we believe our constitution best protects our democracy in this country because it blocks politicians from total and absolute power.” Benwell said while the ARM had every right to write to Charles requesting a meeting, it would have been a breach of protocol for the King to have accepted their invitation. “The King cannot officially meet with me, just as he cannot officially meet with the republicans, because [the republic question] is an ongoing issue in this country. He’s here to meet the people, not to become involved in political issues, he’s above that as king.”",Kate Lyons
most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/13/limp-bizkit-universal-music-group-lawsuit,,Limp Bizkit’s fraud lawsuit rattles music industry: ‘These accusations are massive’ | Limp Bizkit | The Guardian,,"One of the world’s largest music companies has been accused of depriving “potentially hundreds” of artists and bands of their royalties by the 90s nu-metal bandLimp Bizkit. Three decades after it rose to prominence, the band and its founder, Fred Durst, alleges thatUniversal MusicGroup (UMG) owes more than $200m after fraudulently concealing royalties from the band.  In a lawsuit filed inCalifornia, attorneys representing Durst, Limp Bizkit and Flawless Records accused UMG of using software “deliberately designed to conceal artists’ (including Plaintiffs’) royalties” so it can pocket the profits. UMG is one of the most powerful forces in the global music industry, with a roster spanning from Taylor Swift and Neil Diamond to Dr Dre and Renee Rapp. The company did not respond to multiple invitations tocomment. Limp Bizkit claims it was not paid “a single cent by UMG in any royalties” until taking legal action, despite a “tremendous” resurgence in popularity in recent years, with its songs played hundreds of millions of times on streaming platforms in 2024 alone. The lawsuit, filed in California federal court, claims that many more bands and acts might also be getting shortchanged. Attorneys for Durst, Limp Bizkit and Flawless Records go so far as to suggest that a pre-trial discovery process – in which both sides of a case exchange information – will “show that potentially hundreds of other artists have likewise been wrongfully defrauded regarding their royalties, showing that the system was intentionally designed to commit fraud on Plaintiffs and other artists”. “These accusations are massive,” said Jay Gilbert, a music industry consultant and former executive at UMG and Warner Music Group. He is skeptical. “My gut tells me that this isn’t a systematic scheme to withhold royalties. It’s more of an accounting issue that’s blown up,” Gilbert said. “It sounded pretty damning and pretty heavy-handed, but in my experience, I think it’s something less dramatic.” This lawsuit was “the nuclear option”, added Mark Tavern, who previously worked at record companies including UMG and Sony Music. “I think it’s designed to force a settlement, and make it happen quickly.” “It’s a bit over the top,” said Tavern, who now lectures on the music industry at the University of New Haven. “It can probably be easily explained by bureaucracy, or incompetence,” or the sheer volume of payments processed by a music firm as large as UMG, he said. Durst claims he was told by UMG that he had not received any royalty statements because his account was still so far from recoupment, with executives at the firm suggesting it had paid Limp Bizkit some $43m in advances over the years, according to the lawsuit. When representatives of Durst and Limp Bizkit gained access to UMG’s portal for royalty statements in April, however, they claim to have noticed balances that indicated it owed more than $1m. In August, UMG paid just over $1m to Limp Bizkit and $2.3m to Flawless Records, according to the lawsuit, which says executives blamed the failure to pay sooner on an error with new software. Questions over royalty payments arise “all the time”, according to Gilbert, but rarely explode into the open. “This sort of dirty laundry is not aired commonly,” he said, with issues typically resolved through audits “behind the scenes”. The global music industry has been rapidly transformed over recent decades, first by the rise of downloads, and then by streaming. Finding and listening to songs has never been easier, thanks to hundreds of millions of tracks that stack the libraries of platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. Take Break Stuff by Limp Bizkit. It was first released in May 2000, but you might hear it in passing while watching TV, scrolling through social media, or playing a video game. Gone are the days when you would visit a local record store, go through the racks, find the album, and ultimately listen back to the song. It’s just a few taps away. Even Limp Bizkit’s attorneys acknowledged that the band – which split up in 2006, and reformed in 2009 – had a “relatively quiet period” in the early 2010s. In the lawsuit, however, they claim that interest in the band began to increase “exponentially” around 2017, leading it to sell out arenas and headline festivals. “There is a big pop-punk revival going on,” observed Tavern. “The current generation [of fans] is looking back 20 or 25 years.” Such “heritage” acts and artists, as they are referred to by music industry executives, are prized by record labels. UMG sought Durst’s approval to reissue Limp Bizkit’s 2000 album Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water on vinyl last year, according to the lawsuit, and “repeatedly asked” him to get involved with an anniversary rerelease of Significant Other, another of its albums. To Durst, it seemed like a “money grab”. The complaint alleges that the plaintiffs are still owed much more than they have been paid. Durst, Limp Bizkit and Flawless Records are demanding a jury trial. Their case is already making waves. ​“Everyone is talking about it,” observed Tavern, who noted the complicated nature of calculating music royalties in the streaming era had led to widespread confusion – and, sometimes, suspicion of the industry’s dominant firms. ​ “The way the money gets paid is totally different now, and much more convoluted,” he said. “You can point to 450 million streams, but that is not the same as 450 million records.” Gilbert said: “I think cooler heads will prevail,” suggesting that attorneys for either side would probably meet privately to examine the facts. “This thing will be resolved,” he said. “I think it’s going to go away.”",Callum Jones

He repeated this claim at a rally on Friday. Aurora’s mayor, Mike Coffman, said Trump’s claims are “grossly exaggerated”. “Well, Martha, you just said the mayor said they were exaggerated. That means there’s got to be some element of truth here,” JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, said during an interview on ABC’s This Week. “Unfortunately, when you let people in by the millions, most of whom are unvetted, most of whom you don’t know who they really are, you’re going to have problems like this,” Vance added. Michigan governorGretchen Whitmerhas apologized for feeding a Doritos chip to a social media influencer who dropped to her knees after Roman Catholic organizations accused the Democratic politician of insulting their religion by mocking the sacrament of communion. “I would never do something to denigrate someone’s faith,” Whitmer said in a statement that her office provided to the Michigan television news stationWJBKon Friday. She explained that the stunt in question – captured onvideowith popular TikTok content creatorLiz Plank– was meant to promote legislation signed by Joe Biden in 2022 that is colloquially known as the Chips Act and provided $280bn to research as well as manufacture semiconductors. But it was all “construed as something it was never intended to be, and I apologize for that”, Whitmer said. On the video, Plank genuflects before Whitmer, who then places a Doritos chip in the podcaster and influencer’s mouth. The governor caps the scene off by gazing at the camera while she wears a hat supporting fellow DemocratKamala Harrisand her running mate Tim Walz in November’s presidential election. The Michigan Catholic Conference – which hasclashedwith Whitmer over her support of abortion rights – joined other church groups in condemning Whitmer’s video with Plank. More on the controversial video here:  Updated at20.07 BST Donald Trump called those who have opposed or investigated him “the enemy from within”. “I always say, we have two enemies,” Trump said in an interview on Fox Business’s Sunday Morning Futures. “We have the outside enemy, and then we have the enemy from within, and the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia and all these countries.” He said that what a president might find hard to handle “are these lunatics that we have inside, likeAdam Schiff” referring to the California congressman and US Senate candidate who was part of a House committee that investigated the US Capitol attack carried out by Trump’s supporters after he lost the 2020 election to Biden.

Updated at18.38 BST Kamala HarrisandDonald Trumpspent Sunday trying to shore up political support among what they perceived to be must-have voting blocs with polls showing them locked in a tight 5 November presidential race. With election day less than a month away, the Democratic vice-president attended a Black church in Greenville, North Carolina, as part of her campaign’s “souls to the polls” push. Her Republican opponent was in Arizona, looking for Black and Latino support as he seeks a second presidency, after a rally in California a day earlier. Both candidates are attempting to get a decisive edge among votes who have not yet decided who to support. Surveys show that early voting, which tends to favor Democrats, is down 45% from previous election years – a sign that there may be millions of undecided voters. Trump has now switched from condemning early voting as a Democrat plot to engineer his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020 to urging people to vote early and by mail. A recent ABC News-Ipsospollshowed that support was split down gender lines, with women voting 60-40 to Harris and men breaking for Trump by a similar margin. Trump needs white women, who supported him in a greater numbers in 2020 than in 2016 – but also Black men. On Sunday, he argued that his fellow former president Barack Obama’s call last week for Black men to support Harris based “solely on her skin color, rather than her policies” as “deeply insulting”. Here’s more on the candidates’ campaign events:  Updated at18.24 BST Ramon Antonio Vargas Donald Trumpon Sunday said he does not expect chaos from his supporters on the day of the 5 November election. Asked on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures if he anticipated chaos from those who support him overKamala Harris, the former president said: “No, I don’t think. Not from the side that votes for Trump.” Supporters of Trump aimed a deadly attack on Congress weeks after he lost the presidency toJoe Bidenin 2020. The US Capitol attack – launched after he told his supporters to fight like hell – was a desperate attempt to prevent congressional certification of the US president’s victory. Hundreds of participants have been indicted on federal crimes pertaining to the violence. And Trump himself was criminally charged with illicitly trying to overturn his 2020 defeat in the lead-up to the attack, including by lying about how fraudsters robbed him of winning against Biden.  Updated at20.07 BST Homeland security secretaryAlejandro Mayorkason Sunday said the slew of misinformation online about the hurricanes devastating parts of the US is “extremely pernicious”.

She handed over the letters written on notepaper headed “The Vice President”. One said: “Dear teacher, please excuse Dani from class today. She was hanging out with us. Best and thank you for being an educator. Kamala.” It was an unscripted moment that the studio audience loved but TV viewers wouldn’t see. Harris, running the shortest presidential campaign in modern US history after being unexpectedly plunged into the fight when Joe Biden dropped out, is exploring ways to reveal herself to a wary nation. Still a relatively unknown quantity, the former California attorney general and US senator is trying to make the electorate feel comfortable about the prospect of PresidentKamala Harris. In less than three months the vice-president has raiseda record-breaking billion dollars. She has tried to put daylight between herself and the unpopular incumbent figure of Biden, andturn the election into a referendumon her opponent, former US president Donald Trump. She has sought to bring positive vibes to a country that seems to have anxiety in its bones. She has set out to persuade America to do something that it has never done before in its 248-year existence: elect a woman to the White House – and a woman of colour to boot. Here’s more on Harris’s media blitz: Republican’s lies about immigrants eating cats in Ohio has led to swell of far-right extremism in Springfield – and beyond For Denise Williams, the 70-year-old head of Springfield’s NAACP chapter, the past several weeks have been testing to say the least. Last month,flyerscalling for mass deportations of immigrants were distributed by the so-called Trinity White Knights, a group associated with the Ku Klux Klan, in Black-majority neighborhoods in south Springfield. “I’m telling people: do nothing – don’t approach them. But it’s not easy for people to see this,” she said. “I think that is what a lot of folks cannot understand – why do we have so much hate?” About 22% of Springfield residents are African American,according to the US Census Bureau. “People are mad. African Americans here don’t understand how this is allowed. We just have to take this for a minute. I know it’s hard.” Trinity White Knights is headquartered in Kentucky,whereflyers were also seen by residents of the Cincinnati suburb of Covington in July as part of an apparent recruitment effort. The flyers included a PO box address in Maysville, Kentucky, and a phone number. Ever since Donald Trump claimed during a 10 September televised debate watched by 67 million people that immigrants in Springfield were eating people’s pets – a claim that has beenfound to be baseless– Springfield has seen a groundswell in far-right extremism. Here’s more context on the rise in far-right extremism: Three major polls were released Sunday, showing Vice-PresidentKamala Harriseither ahead of former president Donald Trump or running a head-to-head race. Let’s start with theABC News/Ipsos poll: Harris is ahead by two percentage points with 50% of the support. The poll, conducted between 4 to 8 October, found that 56% of Americans favor deporting all undocumented immigrants, helping Trump’s lead in trust to handle immigration at the US-Mexico border. Meanwhile,NBC’s poll, conducted during the same time, shows Harris with support from 48% of registered voters, while Trump has the same percentage of support. Another 4% say they are undecided or wouldn’t vote for either option. CBS also conducted apollearlier this month, revealing a lead by Harris with 51% support compared to Trump’s 48%. The economy and policy surrounding the US-Mexico border are among the top issues voters are placing as top priorities when deciding on the next president.  Updated at18.06 BST Speaker Mike Johnsonsaid that passing additional hurricane aid for states impacted by hurricanesHeleneandMilton“can wait” until Congress is back in session after the election. On Sunday, Johnson CBS’s Face the Nation, where host Margaret Brennan asked him why he thinks it’s fine to wait until November for Congress to pass more aid for Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton victims. “Well, it can wait because, remember, the day before Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida and then went up through the states and wound up inSenator Tillis’sstate of North Carolina, Congress appropriated 20 billion additional dollars to FEMA so that they would have the necessary resources to address immediate needs,” Johnson said. Tillis was part of a bipartisan group of senators that signed a letter urging lawmakers to think about bringing Congress members back into session this month to pass disaster legislation before the year’s end.  Updated at18.05 BST Democraticsenator Raphael Warnock from Georgia said he does not believe Black men will show up for former President Trump in large numbers. During CNN’s State of the Union with Dana Bash, Warnock said: Black men are not going to vote for Donald Trump in any significant numbers. There will be some. We’re not a monolith. He was responding to a New York Timespollingthat placed Kamala Harris behind Joe Biden among Black voters. Warnock alluded to the late 80s case of theCentral Park Five, where the brutal assault of a New York jogger in Central Park led to Trump taking out full-page ads in the city’s major newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty for those responsible. “When it was proven that the Exonerated 5, the Central Park 5, were actually innocent,Donald Trumphas shown no deal of concern about what they went through, no deal, no bit of contrition about it,” Warnock said.  Updated at18.03 BST Good morning,US politicsblog readers. There’s another busy news day ahead of us and we’ll keep up with all the developments as they happen. Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, later today. Kamala Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, will head to a Get Out the Jewish Vote campaign event in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. He will later deliver remarks at aGirl Dads for Harris-Walzphone bank in Delaware County. Several polls released on Sunday show Vice-President Kamala Harris in the lead or in a tight race with former president Donald Trump. AnABC News/Ipsos pollshows 50% support for Harris and 48% for Trump, while the latest nationalNBC News pollshows Trump and Harris are deadlocked. Here’s what else is happening: Kamala Harrison Saturdayreleased a reporton her health and medical history, which found that “she possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency” if voters elect her in November. A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president’s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions aboutDonald Trump’s physical fitness and mental acuity. Tighteningpoll figureshave triggered nervousness and anxiety in Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, with Donald Trump making gains in the states where it matters most as the election race enters its climactic final phase, according to The Guardian’s 10-day polling average tracker.

Hunger inLebanoncould soar amid Israeli onslaught on the country, a leading UN expert has warned. The Guardian’s Nina Lakhani reports: Hunger and malnutrition rates could rise “exponentially” inLebanon, if Israel follows through with threats to escalate the current military operation which has so far killed more than 2,000 and displaced as many as a million people, according to a leading UN expert. “Israel has the ability to starve Lebanon – like it has starved Palestinians in Gaza,” said Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food. “If you look at the geography of Lebanon,Israelhas the power to absolutely put a stranglehold on the food system. There is a huge risk of hunger and malnutrition rates skyrocketing very quickly in Lebanon.” Acute hunger rates could rise very quickly because food security in Lebanon was precarious even before Israel launched its full-scale aerial bombardment in mid-September, as growing hostilities with Hezbollah since 7 October had already displaced 40% of local farmers, disrupting local production and interrupting trade flows and access to markets, according to the UNWorld Food Programme.

Mai al-Afifa, 24, was teaching a workshop about how to identify unexploded ordnance in a school turned shelter in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday when an Israeli missile hit the next building in the compound. Twenty-eight people were killed and 54 injured, according to medics at the scene. Through the smoke and rubble dust Afifa saw the body parts of two women and a male aid worker as she stumbled to safety. The Israeli military said it had used a precise strike to target Hamas fighters using the school as a command centre. “We are very sad about what is happening now in Lebanon … We have experienced this pain and loss,” Afifa said. “But we also fear thatGazawill be forgotten: the massacres have increased here and no one is talking about it. All the TV channels are talking about the regional war, Iran, Israel and what is happening in Lebanon.” For the full story, click here: The US is planning to send an anti-missile system to Israel, the Wall Street Journal reports,citingUS officials. According to the outlet, the US is also planning to send “just under 100 troops in all” to operate the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system. The White House has not released an official statement yet. An Israeli airstrike killed five children in northern Gaza on Sunday, Reuters reports. Citing Palestinian news agency WAFA, Reuters reports that the children were playing near a cafe in the Al-Shati area when they were killed by a drone strike. Since last October, Israel has killed more than 16,400 children in Gaza, making the occupied Palestinian territory the deadliest place in the world for children,according toSave the Children. Former president Donald Trump, who is the Republican presidential candidate, said he spoke with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu “like two days ago”. Trump made the comments in a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday.  Updated at16.37 BST",Maya Yang

Then she noticed that they were constantly complaining about their jobs or their partners without ever taking steps to change. Or else they would select an unsuspecting victim and sink their teeth into them. They didn’t want to hear about Ellie, 35 – the changes she was making in her life, the new business she had started. And they certainly didn’t want to hear that it was going well, she says. “You almost felt like you couldn’t fit in with them unless you were moaning about something.” Maybe you have one of these characters in your life: an old school friend, perhaps, who consistently leaves you feeling worse than before you met up with them. In psychological shorthand, they are known as “emotional vampires”, for their ability to suck the pleasure from a social interaction – and your energy along with it. But what are the signs that you are in one’s clutches, or that you have become one yourself? And how can we best handle such relationships?  “There are some people who have an excessive need for attention and validation,” says Suzy Reading, a psychologist and chartered member of the British Psychological Society. They are often overwhelmingly negative, or display a victim mentality, refusing to believe that anything that happens to them is their fault. “A lot of times, they don’t actually want solutions or advice – they just want to offload,” says Reading. And while they might be intently focused on themselves, “there’s not a great deal of self-awareness”. It’s not just their own patterns of behaviour that these individuals are oblivious to: emotional vampires are defined by their inability to empathise, leading them to vent their frustrations without thinking how it might affect or be received by the other person. Carla Manly, a clinical psychologist based in California, says such behaviour reflects a lack of emotional intelligence. “When somebody is an empathic human being, even if they have a high need, when they reach out for support, they will be aware of your emotional state first.” They might ask you if now is a good time to talk, or pick up on cues that suggest it isn’t. Emotional vampires pay no such mind, says Manly. “They are only caring for their own appetite, their own needs.” The key point is that the behaviour is consistent, even chronic, says Manly. There are many reasons a friend might temporarily be more demanding, or less present, such as after a breakup or a period of poor mental health. But in functional friendships, there is an underlying sense of give and take. “We want somebody to be invested as we are invested; a mutual reciprocity. It’s not always 50-50, but overall there is a sense of balance.” An emotional vampire will resist that equilibrium, betraying a fundamental egocentrism. Any attempts to change the subject can be met with one-upmanship, dismissiveness or even hostility. “If you do then challenge them on it, they’re so resistant that you might end up getting attacked,” says Reading. But to characterise one person as the predatory bloodsucker and the other as their hapless victim can be reductive. After all, vampires can’t prey on just anyone: you have to invite them in. “If someone has managed to get into this position of being completely domineering, then obviously we’ve allowed it to some extent, or possibly enabled it,” says Jenny van Hooff, a sociologist at Manchester Metropolitan University. Even with the best of intentions, it can be all too easy to get sucked into the dynamic. Beth, 38, befriended a friend of a friend, wishing to support her through her first pregnancy. The younger woman struggled with her family and was not in contact with the father of her child and Beth thought she could help. But every time they spoke, Beth felt depleted, depressed and helpless. “I started to realise that I’d repeat the same things over and over again and she would never follow the suggestions, nor listen to me.” When the woman started volunteering information about her childhood traumas, Beth felt that a line had been crossed. “It wasn’t about the trauma per se, but the fact that she would ‘vomit’ information without really listening,” she says. “The next time she called, I told her I only had 15 minutes, and the time after that, I made up an excuse so that we wouldn’t speak.” Reading says it is especially common for women to work to maintain ties they find unrewarding and even actively unpleasant, often having been conditioned to keep the peace and prioritise others’ needs above their own. “Effectively, women are raised to believe that you’re either selfish or selfless.” She often sees adult women struggling to protect themselves against their overbearing mothers: a “particularly painful dynamic” that was probably established in childhood. Emotional vampires might also enter into our lives in the form of co-workers or co-parents, Reading says – making it harder to create distance. Schoolfriends are another common culprit, as people naturally grow apart over time, but feel reluctant to cut longstanding ties. “Just because there’s a legacy to this friendship, it doesn’t mean that you don’t have a right to choose what shape it takes,” says Reading. It’s possible to maintain the relationship and still take steps to protect ourselves. She suggests considering how much you can give to this individual and tailoring the interaction to bring out the best in them. “If you’ve got someone in your social circle that’s really overdramatic, loves chaos and wants to be the centre of attention, maybe don’t go out for coffee with several friends, because it will become that person’s show,” says Reading. Instead, you could go for a walk together, one on one; nature might help to “diffuse that wall of noise”, she suggests. “Or, even better: go and see a film together … Think laterally about how you can enjoy time and space together in a way that feels healthy for you.” Managing our own expectations can also help make those difficult relationships more sustainable, says Manly. Accepting that one particular friend is not inclined to give a listening ear can alleviate your disappointment or anguish when they speak only of themselves. Cutting old friends loose can backfire, she says. “There’s something really precious about those relationships, because they carry the energy of ‘I knew you when’ and ‘You knew me when’ … The minute you part from the relationship, you fracture something in that sense of continuity.” But by recognising the value of those shared experiences and memories, the relationship can become a lot easier to maintain, Manly says – despite all the ways in which you might have grown apart. “We don’t necessarily need to completely cut off the relationship,” she says. “We simply energetically and emotionally create greater distance. And to tell you the truth, when it comes to the emotional vampire, because they are more egocentric, they may not notice it.” Both experts agree that emotional vampires tend to move on when one energy source cuts off the supply. If this seems callous, consider the costs of maintaining the relationship as it is, says Reading. “At the end of the day, it’s also OK to protect your peace.” It can also pay to be more upfront and give a friend a gentle heads-up about how their behaviour is affecting you. It may be an uncomfortable conversation – but it can be productive. For Troy, 32, confronting how he and his friend of a decade had drifted apart was helpful in changing their course. They had met at university, during a period of change in their lives, but in the subsequent years Troy’s friend had got hung up on a messy breakup. For many years, Troy says, they were stuck in a pattern of him being her shoulder to cry on. “Our friendship shifted from a place of feeling mutual to a point where our conversations were always about her and her relationship and how it was affecting her,” he says. “The gravitational pull was always towards the dark things she was going through.” Troy tried to respond with compassion, not only hearing his friend out, but trying different ways to help her move on. “I’d always leave our conversations feeling really down – and also that nothing I was doing was helping,” he says. “There was a period where we even had a moratorium on talking about him, because I was not interested in having the same conversation we’d been having for the past five or six years.” Eventually, Troy began to withdraw, volunteering less about himself and investing less in the friendship. Matters came to a head when his friend said she felt something had changed between them. They ended up having an argument. “It was a very hard conversation and things were said that were not easy for either of us to hear,” says Troy. But it also released the tensions that had been building on both sides. “The fight actually acted as a reset button and we sort of made commitments in terms of how we wanted to be better friends to each other,” he says. When they met again a few weeks later, it felt “much more even – there was a sense that we’d gotten past it”. Being prepared to have those difficult conversations with people who matter to us can be productive, not only for our relationships, but for our sense of who we are within them, Reading says. Particularly in the case of family or close friends: “One of the functions of those relationships is to smooth off each other’s rough edges.” One of Reading’s clients recently told an old friend, who had complained about feeling lonely, how she might be inadvertently pushing people away. The friend took it on, says Reading. “So let’s not write people off. It’s about making that distinction between aniceperson, who doesn’t ruffle feathers, and being akindperson, who is allowing others to learn and grow.” Manly is more circumspect about emotional vampires’ ability to change. “If they are doing even a modicum of self-work, they may be able to hear you, but in most cases they’re not – that’s why they have those patterns.” For any feedback to be received in good faith, “there has to be a desire to change”. There are also often unforeseen costs to “speaking one’s truth”, Manly adds. “It may not get you anywhere and in fact it may create rupture.” Troy says he persevered with his friend because of their shared history and his faith in the real bond underpinning it. When he found himself feeling similarly drained by a looser friendship, he had felt more able to walk away. “She would always complain about being single, how busy work was, about not having any friends,” Troy says. “I became increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that she thought we were best friends, when for me she was someone I saw out of obligation every four months.” These experiences, he says, have taught him “to be more intentional with my friendships and who I devote time to – but also to be more transparent and clear when problems are arising and I can feel that balance shifting in a significant way”. The challenges of vampire friendships may feel particularly heightened and unexpected because the nuclear family has become less dominant as the organising structure of our society. Platonic bonds have been rightly recognised as important and enriching, but the popular description of friends as “the family you choose” can set up unrealistic expectations – and belie the frequent difficulty of navigating them, says Van Hooff. “When you look at research, people maintain friendships that they really do not enjoy.” It’s perhaps in response to the uncritical celebration of friendship as always equal, effortless and enriching that the concept of “emotional vampires” has taken flight, Van Hooff suggests. “The rules of friendships are really opaque and difficult to work out and some people are more skilled at navigating them than others.” The next time you find yourself in a never-ending interview with an emotional vampire, you might look for ways to defang the monster, and even to understand them, before resorting to banishment. But for those starting to feel apprehensive about looking into the mirror, Reading is reassuring. “For anyone thinking: ‘God, am I an energy vampire?’ I think the fact that you’re asking that question would suggest you’re not.” All case study names have been changed",Elle Hunt

The historic feat, which drew praise from astronauts and space experts, topped a successful fifth test flight for the uncrewed Starship, which blasted off from the Boca Chica starbase at 7.25am local time (1325 BST) on Sunday.  As the rocket’s 71-metre (233ft) Super Heavy booster separated 40 miles (65km) above the Earth, the upper stage pushed on to an altitude of nearly 90 miles, looping around the planet at 17,000 mph before splashing down in the Indian Ocean as planned. SpaceX staff erupted in cheers and applause as the falling booster reignited three of its Raptor engines, slowed its rapid descent and swung towards the “mechazilla” launch tower, where it was held fast by the mechanical arms, labelled “chopsticks”. It is the first time SpaceX has attempted the bold manoeuvre, one it sees as crucial to its goal of developing fully reusable rockets capable of ferrying humans, scientific equipment and supplies to the moon and onwards to Mars. “Are you kidding me?” said Dan Huot, SpaceX’s communications manager, who was left shaking at the spectacle. “What we just saw, that looked like magic.” “This is a day for the engineering history books,” added Kate Tice, a quality systems engineer at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. The rest of Starship re-entered Earth’s atmosphere horizontally, with onboard cameras showing a smooth, pinkish-purple plasma covering the ship’s Earth-facing side. The ship’s hot side is coated with 18,000 heat-shielding tiles that were improved since SpaceX’s last test in June, when Starship completed its first full test flight to the Indian Ocean but suffered tile damage that made its re-entry difficult. This time, Starship appeared more intact upon reigniting one of its six engines to position itself upright for the ocean landing. The SpaceX live stream showed the rocket splashing down in the night-time waters off Australia’s coast, then toppling on its side, concluding its test mission. A separate camera view from a vessel near the splashdown site then showed the ship exploding into a vast fireball. It was unclear whether the explosion was a controlled detonation or the result of a fuel leak. Musk said the ship landed “precisely on target!” Commenting on SpaceX’s successful capture of the Starship booster, Chris Hadfield, a Canadian former astronaut,wrote on X: “There was an enormous step forward in human capability today. Makes me even more excited for our collective future. Congratulations to all at SpaceX!”",Ian Sample
most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/13/melania-trump-memoir-review,,Melania by Melania Trump review - a blame-dodging masterclass | Melania Trump | The Guardian,,"Melania Trump’s eponymously titled memoir is a 180-page exercise in buck-passing and blame-dodging. The former US first lady blames staffers for plagiarizing Michelle Obama; repeatedly stresses her love for her husband despite professing to abhor lying liars who lie; anddeclaresabortion afundamental right, without pausing to considerDonald Trump’s role in attacking it via the US supreme court. Melania is by no means an exhaustive read, but it does leave the reader asking why she has chosen to bare her soul just weeks before theelection. Or whetherKamala Harrismight more accurately channel her policy preferences than her husband, the Republican nominee yet again.  Many subjects are missing. Not surprisingly, Melania has nothing to say about other women in her husband’s life: E Jean Carroll (the woman Donald defamed andsexually assaulted); Stormy Daniels (the adult film star whose hush-money payments led to Donald’s criminalconviction); Karen McDougal (the former Playboy Playmate who alsohad an affairwith Donald). There are less than a handful of passing references to Ivanka, Donald’s oldest daughter who hesaidhe would have dated if she weren’t flesh and blood and who Melania is widelyreportedto loathe. Trump’s children by other women barely get a look-in. Melania does repeatedly say she loves her own son, Barron, and her parents too. True to form, no clue is offered as to who assisted in writing Melania. In contrast toBreaking History, the White House memoir by Jared Kushner, Ivanka’s husband, Melania does not offer acknowledgments. It’s a decent bet someone lent her a hand. Her book does contain 64 pages of photographs. The lead-off is a passport page, stamped on 27 August 1996 at JFK in New York, the day Melania arrived in the US. The final page includes a “digital collectible”, available frommelaniatrump.com. Like her husband, the brand is all. “Financial independence is a core value of mine,” Melania writes. “Melania Timepieces and Jewelry represented my passion, my project and my business – a symbol of independence, self-respect and empowerment for all women.” Understandably, Melania’s takes on policy have received more attention. Without mention ofDobbs v Jackson, the ruling by which a supreme court including three hardliners installed by Donald Trump gutted the constitutional right to abortion and privacy, her stand for personal freedom isfull-throated. “It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,” she thunders. “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.” Simply put, such words jar with her party’s record. And yet, another chapter is more telling still. Melania dumps on staffers for drafting the speech to the 2016 Republican convention in whichshe plagiarized Michelle Obama. Except Melania manages also to point the finger at herself. “During my review of many speeches of previous first ladies, Michelle’s emphasis on the fundamental values of hard work, integrity, and kindness resonated deeply,” she writes, of a conversation with the aide who wrote the speech. In other words, Melania shows she was familiar with Michelle Obama’s 2008 speech to the Democratic convention, portions of which she would repeat to Republicans in Cleveland in 2016. There’s more. Before speaking at the RNC, Melania “rehearsed multiple times with the teleprompter, feeling confident in my delivery”. And yet, she claims, when the plagiarism was noticed and a media firestorm blew up, she was shocked. “Upon closer examination, the undeniable similarities between the two speeches left me reeling.” Really? “I trusted that any and all political and legal vetting had been taken care of, but now I realized that the campaign and RNC had left me on my own.” Talk about throwing the staff under any passing bus. And yet, to quote the deathless words of Kimberly Guilfoyle, Don Jr’s fiancée: “The best is yet to come.” “‘Why was the speech not vetted?’, I asked Donald in frustration … From then on, I realized the importance of being intimately involved with every detail of my public life. No longer would I delegate specific tasks or trust others to ensure my reputation was protected.” Specifically, Melania blames Meredith McIver of the Trump Organization – to whom she says she herself read Michelle Obama’s words, words Melania then repeatedly practiced. As the saying goes, shit rolls downhill. When it comes to her husband, too, Melania is not in the blame game. The chaos ofJanuary 6is dealt with as swiftly as anything inconvenient that actually makes it to her pages. She wags her finger at those who assaulted the Capitol in an attempt to overturn Donald’s 2020 defeat but also claims to have been unaware of events for most of that terrible day. “The violence we witnessed was unequivocally unacceptable,” she writes. But in her next breath, she adds that she “recognized that many individuals felt the election was mishandled and that the vice president should halt the confirmation process”. Naturally, Melania’s take on protests following the murder of George Floyd is far more strident, complete with a condemnation of “the inflammatory rhetoric of Black Lives Matter leaders”. Indeed, she does not expressly name Floyd, the Minneapolis man whose murder by police triggered the long hot protest summer of 2020. As for her husband’s exhortation to the far-right Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” around the election, or his forecast of a “Big protest in DC on January 6th[,] Be there, will be wild!”, or his exhortation to followers to “fight like hell”? Crickets. Almost eight years have passed since Melaniareportedly cried in sorrowon election night 2016, when her husband won the White House. She could yet return. Maybe that will provide enough material for another 180 pages.",Lloyd Green

Some of the unique plants in this rainforest can trace their lineage back 40 or 50m years when the Gondwana supercontinent was breaking apart and Australia was detaching itself from what is now Antarctica.  Take only a few steps from the cool shade and you emerge to something altogether different. Still rainforest, but changing fast. Soil and rocks are exposed and, above, the leafless branches of tall and dead trees let the sunlight strike the forest floor. This is a place packed with threatened species, including the nightcap oak – a true Gondwanan relic that grows nowhere else. On the ground and at the base of the thin-barked trees is charcoal. Five years ago, chunks of this rainforest not evolved to burn, did burn, during what became known as Australia’s black summer bushfires. “It can take a lot of these trees a long time to die. It is a long, slow death,” says Dr Robert Kooyman, an evolutionary ecologist who has spent more than 40 years working and studying the rainforests in and around Nightcap national park in northernNew South Wales. About 73,000 sq km of forest were burned in the east and south of the country during black summer and the fires scorched the habitat of about3 billion native animals. Half of the world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests – a network of 40 parks and reserves – were affected by the fires that were driven by global heating. Fires burned into about 10% of the rainforest in the Nightcap area and affected about 30% of the rainforest’s margin, says Kooyman. Kooyman discovered the nightcap oak in the late 1980s. Unlike Australia’s many eucalypt species, rainforest trees have not evolved to deal with fire. “It burns around the base and it cooks the cambium layer – the live wood – and the bark. It triggers this slow-motion death and you can see the progressive stages here,” he says, pointing to trees in various stages of that slow death. The fires killed about a third of the mature nightcap oaks, he says, leaving 181 behind. Kooyman’s monitoring shows 72 of those are struggling to survive, or have lost their main stem and now persist “as suckers only”. “That one’s on the way out,” says Kooyman, pointing to a nightcap whose bark and stem is split and is covered by fungi. “That one is failing too,” says Kooyman, pointing to another. “And this was a low-intensity burn.” There is smoke in the air from a nearby hazard reduction burn on the day Kooyman takes us to the marked-out plots where he and colleagues are monitoring every post-fire breath, death and revival. Traps made from net and laundry baskets catch and record whatever falls from the canopy; straps called dendrometers measure trunk growth; and then there are recordings of temperature, humidity, light and seed generation, and the state of the soil. “They can shrink before they die,” says Kooyman, pointing to one of the dendrometers. “The theory of negative growth is real – that would drive the economists crazy,” he laughs. As we leave to look at another patch of burnt rainforest, Kooyman yanks a young wattle that’s sprouting. The fires removed the leaf litter on the forest floor, creating a perfect bed for dormant wattle seeds to germinate. They have been growing at an incredible density – as many as 30,000 a hectare (12,100 an acre). “They’ll create a fire influence inside the rainforest,” he says. “If we had a dry season and another fire, there are huge amounts of this vegetation that would explode in flames. That’s the problem. You end up with a fire-prone landscape.” The fires here were followed within months by torrential rain and violent floods that blasted the banks of the rock-strewn creeks and swept away weakened trees and plants. Kooyman used to see platypus here but since the fires, there’s no sign. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion More than once on this day, Kooyman bristles when the word “recovery” comes up. For fire-adapted forests, the word “recovery” might be fair, but not for rainforests, he says. “Let’s not let this terminology overwhelm us. This is not recovery,” he says, pointing to a 2ft-tall sucker growing from the base of a dead trunk. “What we have discovered is that even after almost five years, the trajectory is still in reverse. The impacts are accumulating and it hasn’t stabilised.” “Do we want these forests in the future? Do we log them? Do we have them crisped by climate change, or do we start compensating for what we know is happening and protect them?” The fire that hit Nightcap national park and the neighbouring Whian Whian state conservation area started in late October as a lightning strike and gained momentum as the extreme heat and dry of 2019 was joined by winds. Kooyman is an honorary research fellow at Sydney’s Macquarie University, a researcher at the city’s Royal Botanical Gardens and scientist with Missouri Botanical Gardens programs in west Africa and Madagascar. But he lives less than an hour’s drive from Nightcap and got to his beloved rainforest within days as the ground was still smouldering. “I did find myself, not depressed but, maybe like PTSD working in these impact zones. I’m not inclined to any level of depression, but this has had an impact on me. You catch yourself being a little angrier or shorter [tempered] than usual. “Having never lived through these sorts of events at those scales it takes some adjusting.” Kooyman is 71, but he moves like someone half his age. Several times this morning, he jumps from his four-wheel drive to chainsaw trees that have fallen across the track. “I’m feeling an urgency now and it’s not so much down to my sunset clause,” he says. In a break, he puts his laptop on the bonnet to show some images of his plots. They look like landscape ink drawings of the forest you might hang on your wall. But these delicate strokes are the artefacts of data from laser scans of the parts of the forest he’s been monitoring. The areas that escaped the fire have a dense and continuous canopy shrouding the understory. But the scans taken from areas that burned show a canopy that is barely a canopy at all. Technology is moving fast and Kooyman is excited that new approaches, like LiDAR scanning, could give him answers to questions he has been chasing his whole career. “We’re getting deeper insights into how these rainforest systems work. So I’m excited,” he says. “But the irony is we’re getting better at measuring decline.”",Graham Readfearn

In July, clinic notes from a vet intended for a greyhound trainer were mistakenly sent to a rehoming group that had recently been to the same vet for treatment of a rescue dog.  “They aren’t our usual vet. We had requested a record of vaccination so it was a real shock to see the word euthanasia pop up on the screen,” Elle Fisk from Greyt Greys Rescue told Guardian Australia. The notes, seen by Guardian Australia, show a trainer found their 12-month-old greyhound with a leg injury on their property. The vet suspected a fracture but the owner refused X-rays or treatment and instead requested euthanasia. “The thing that shocked us the most was not only the age of the dog, but the fact that the vet had stated the owner was not interested in treatment,” Fisk said. “Once these dogs aren’t making money, they are treated like rubbish and discarded.” The incident is not an isolated case. In September, the Victorian Racing Tribunal found a registered public trainer and breeder brought the industry into disrepute by having a dog unnecessarily euthanised in 2022. The tribunal heard the experienced trainer told a vet there was a lameness issue and repeatedly asked her to “just euthanise the dog”. They did not allow the greyhound to be medically examined before the procedure but the vet told the tribunal it “did not appear injured and there was no obvious fracture” and it was standing “OK on all four legs”. The tribunal determined the trainer made “no effort at all” to rehome the greyhound and deemed the euthanasia “unnecessary”. Penalty findings for the case are ongoing and have been requested in written form due to the trainer’s “aggressive outbursts” during the hearing. In another case from 2022, a different trainer was found by the tribunal to have euthanised nine dogs between 2016 and 2019 without any effort to rehome them and without notifying the body that oversees the industry, Greyhound Racing Victoria. Instead, the trainer misled the GRV by reporting the dogs as “retired pets”. “Each dog was euthanised … and it was always your intention that this would happen,” the tribunal’s finding reads. In New South Wales, similar concerns have also emerged, witha report by the greyhound racing peak body’s former chief vet Dr Alex Brittanalleging some vets in the industry willingly euthanise large numbers of greyhounds. The report, which has led to an independent inquiry, named two vets “responsible for half the euthanasia in NSW”. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The Victorian state Animal Justice party MP Georgie Purcell said there is no way to know how many healthy greyhounds are being euthanised in Victoria because GRV does not publish a breakdown of deaths. Its annual report has previously only included an overall figure for euthanasia as well as “racing fatalities” – deaths that occur instantaneously on the track. In the 2022-23 reporting period, GRV recorded 382 euthanasia deaths and 40 racing fatalities. “It’s really misleading to the public because euthanasia sounds like it was in the best interest of the dog,” Purcell said. “But we know there are dogs with treatable injuries that industry participants just want dead because they might not be economically viable any more.” In parliament on Wednesday, Purcell will move a motion that, if passed, would force GRV to report how many dogs are killed off-track and the specific reasons for that. The motion also proposes that any deaths occurring within 10 days of a race, training or trial be reclassified as racing fatalities. In response, GRV said its latest figures show racing fatalities in Victoria have decreased by 47% over the past five years. “Instances of euthanasia have also declined by nearly 40% … as a result of GRV’s dedication to ensuring all healthy retired greyhounds are rehomed as pets once their racing careers are over,” it said.

most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/13/muslims-in-india-face-discrimination-after-restaurants-forced-to-display-workers-names,,Muslims in India face discrimination after restaurants forced to display workers’ names | India | The Guardian,,"Muslims inIndiasay they have been fired from their jobs and face the closure of their businesses after two states brought in a “discriminatory” policy making it mandatory for restaurants to publicly display the names of all their employees. The policy was first introduced by Yogi Adityanath, the hardline Hindu monk who is the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Last month the state of Himachal Pradesh, governed by the opposition Congress party, announced it would also make it compulsory for all names of workers and employees to be put on display.  Both state governments have said it is to ensure compliance with health and safety rules and vending regulations in the north Indian states. However, locals and activists have alleged that the new rules are instead a thinly veiled attack on Muslim workers and establishments. Names in India widely signify religion and caste and there are growing fears among Muslim business owners in Uttar Pradesh that this will lead to targeted attacks or economic boycotts, particularly by hardline Hindu groups that are active in the state. “This order is dangerous, it forces us to wear our religion on our sleeve,” said Tabish Aalam, 28, who comes from a long line of specialist chefs in the city of Lucknow. “I am sure the government knows this, and that is why it is being exploited.” Uttar Pradesh is governed by theHindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party(BJP) that also rules at the centre under the prime minister, Narendra Modi, whose decade in power has been marked bygrowing anti-Muslim discriminationand attacks. Adityanath is viewed as one of the most hardline leaders in the BJP. Since hebecame chief minister in 2017, he has introduced a flurry of policies that are accused of enabling the targeting of Muslims or fuelling anti-Muslim conspiracy theories. Business owners in Uttar Pradesh said they had fired Muslim staff as a result of the new laws, fearing they would become a target. Other Muslim-run businesses said they had already been harassed as a result of the policy, with some considering closure. Rafiq, 45, the Muslim owner of a highway restaurant in the Uttar Pradesh city of Muzaffarnagar, said he had fired his four Muslim employees in July after police demanded he put the names of all workers on a sign outside. “I had to fire my Muslim staff because I was concerned for their safety following the order,” he said. “Displaying names makes us vulnerable and a very easy target. If, for instance, there is communal tension that keeps taking place, we will be easily identified as Muslims and targeted.” Rafiq said he had little doubt as to why the Adityanath government was enforcing these new rules. “Displaying names will identify people’s religions, which I suspect is intended to discourage people from eating at Muslim-owned or Muslim-staffed restaurants,” he said. So far, Rafiq said, he had resisted police pressure to comply, but he said that if he was forced to, he would probably shut down his business altogether. Calls for economic boycotts of Muslims have been prominent in the state and there have been rising incidents of attacks against Muslim vendors over the past five years. Last month, the state leader of Bajrang Dal, a rightwing Hindu vigilante group, was captured on video at a meeting calling for attenders to pledge: “I will not buy goods from any Muslim shopkeeper.” Among the Muslims recently fired from a job as a cook was Idrees Ahmed, 31, who had held the position for seven years. He alleged he was among several Muslim members of staff let go as a result of the new policy. “The owner of the restaurant is a Hindu, and most of the other staff members were also Hindu,” Ahmed said. “When the order was issued, the owner called me and other Muslim staff members and apologised before asking us to go home.” Ahmed said he had been “emotionally shattered” by the ordeal and was struggling to support his family of five as no other restaurants would hire him. “I lost a job simply because of my religion,” he said. “I know so many Muslims who were working in different restaurants but were fired after the order.” In Muzaffarnagar, some alleged that only Muslim-owned businesses were being forced to comply. Mohammad Azeem, 42, who runs a small roadside stall, said he was the only business owner harassed by police to display his name on a sign. “The administration is deliberately trying to create a divide,” he said. “Why did they ask me selectively?” Praveen Garg, a BJP spokesperson in Uttar Pradesh, said the policy was to ensure restaurant hygiene, and he emphasised that “nobody is being denied permission to work”. “The government was obligated to take this action after becoming aware of situations in which food was purposefully contaminated,” Garg said. “There have been instances where persons from a specific community have been caught polluting meals with dirty items that a Hindu cannot consume.” Several incidents suggesting that vendors had mixed spit and urine with food and drink items recently went viral and led to arrests in the state. However, despite allegations by rightwing Hindu groups that there was a Muslim conspiracy to commit “spit jihad”, there was no evidence that the incidents were specifically targeted at Hindus. In July, India’s supreme court blocked a separate order by the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments – both BJP-ruled states – that had demanded restaurants along the route of an annual Hindu pilgrimage display the names of their owners and operators. A petition against the order brought by opposition politicians argued that it was “discriminatory on grounds of religion”. Despite the controversy and allegations of stirring up religious division, in September the state government of Himachal Pradesh said it would soon be following Uttar Pradesh’s example. It cited food hygiene as well as fears over an “influx of migrants” as the reasons behind bringing in the policy. Vikramaditya Singh, a Himachal Pradesh Congress leader and state minister, said the matter was still under deliberation. “There will be no compromise with the internal security of the state. The law is applicable for everybody. Why should one particular community feel threatened or have apprehensions?” said Singh. However, he added that if there were widespread concerns about the display of names “then some other way will be explored”. Business owners accused the local Congress party of going against its pledges of secularism and using the divisive policy to court the Hindu-majority vote in the state. Sharik Ali, 27, who runs a small restaurant in Shimla, in Himachal Pradesh, said: “I will not feel safe after displaying my name on my stall. We have seen how Muslims across India have been attacked in the last 10 years of Modi’s rule, but I was not expecting this from the Congress government. They know what will fetch them votes.”",Hannah Ellis-Petersen

Back then, he says, circumnavigating the globe was the height of human achievement. But those sailors, some of whom were coincidentally hoping to find a mythical fountain of youth, left port without knowing what really lay ahead. The same is true forJohnson, 47, who sees himself as a modern-day explorer. Like those sailors, he too is pushing the bounds of what is humanly attainable. Not by circumnavigating the globe, but by circumventing death. Johnson’s odyssey involves ingesting111 pillsa day, eating his last (vegan) meal of the day at 11am, staying teetotal, doing an hour of exercise daily and going to bed at 8.30pm. But is it scientifically possible to slow our ageing like this? Or is his plan more likely to end up shipwrecked by reality?  Living to even 100 is extremely difficult. In his recent bookJellyfish Age Backwards, the Danish molecular biologist Nicklas Brendborg estimated that it’s as hard to survive from 93 to 100 as it is to make it from birth to 93. And most would consider 93 a decent innings. “Your chance of being sick or dying increases exponentially with time,” says Prof Richard Faragher from Brighton University. Plentiful evidence suggests that a healthy lifestylecan add up to 14 years to our lives. But given UK life expectancy is about 81, this isn’t likely to make us centenarians. Anda new studyshows that the rise in life expectancy is slowing down. But if we adoptextremelyhealthy lifestyles, might we liveextremelylong lives? Not really. Extreme longevity is seemingly more genetically driven than normal ageing, meaning diet and exercise may only have a limited impact, says Lynne Cox, an Oxford University professor. “I don’t think there’s a panacea that’s going to add 20 or 30 years to human life at the moment,” she says. Take exercise – which clearly is good for us. One study of 55- to 79-year-old amateur cyclistsfound they were biologically young for their age. In particular, their immune systems hadn’t declined like their non-exercising peers. But that doesn’t mean we should do ever more exercise.Another recent studyon Finnish twins, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found moderate exercisers were biologically younger than those who did no exercise – and, strikingly, those who did a lot. “You really want to be in the sweet spot with exercise,” says Cox. “Super fit athletes don’t necessarily seem to be living any longer.” As for diet, research shows that cutting calories candouble the lifespan of nematode worms. Meanwhile, calorie-restricted mice can live about 30-40% longer, particularlyif they do intermittent fasting. Results in rhesus monkeys have been contradictory, but calorie-restricted monkeys appear healthier andmay livea couple of extra years. Johnson, who is restricting his calories by 10%, is hoping it will work for him, too. But the restrictions in the animal studies are large (a 30-40% reduction in calories) and humans aren’t mice – or nematode worms. While a few studiesshow health benefits for humans,it’s difficult to verify that participants really maintained the restricted diets. Plus, says Cox, “it’s very, very hard to not become malnourished if you’re cutting out 30% of your calories. It can actually be detrimental.” This is particularly true if you’re older, losing muscle mass, or restricting your calories indefinitely. Research shows older, calorie-restricted miceare at a higher risk of dying from infections. Weight-loss jabs such as Ozempic are also popular among longevity enthusiasts – though Johnson says he hasn’t tried it. New research shows they cut the risk of many age-related diseases,including cardiovascular diseasesand cancer,leaving researchers optimisticthey could extend life. But we won’t know their impact on lifespan for decades. They also come with potentially life-threatening side-effects, including pancreatitis. It’s also worth noting that skinny people don’t seem to live the longest. Strikingly, overweight peoplelive longerthan their underweight, normal and obese peers. Some people do enjoy very long lives. The world’s “blue zones” (regions identified as having populations who live healthier and longer lives than others) – which include Sardinia in Italy, Okinawa in Japan andIkaria in Greece–have spawned an industryof lifestyle interventions, supplements and cookbooks. But a study by Saul Newman from University College London, which is now being peer reviewed, suggests much data on human centenarians is bogus. “I tracked down 80% of the people in the world who were older than 110,” says Newman, who found almost none of them had a birth certificate. “It’s a statistical garbage pile.” Alarm bells have been ringing for a while. In 2010, aJapanese government reviewdiscovered 230,000 of the country’s centenarians were missing – presumably dead. And Newman says data suggests that some 72% of Greek centenarians are dead or missing, but their relatives haven’t declared as much, possibly to keep collecting their pensions. Newman believes this is why blue zones appear in poor, rural areas, places where there’s substandard record-keeping and pressure to commit pension fraud. In the UK, the relatively poor London borough of Tower Hamlets has thehighest proportion of 105-year-oldsin the country, despite having a lower-than-average life expectancy overall. And longevity is linked to wealth – the countries in the world with the highest average life expectancy are rich ones. “The old-age suicide rate in Okinawa is the fourth highest in Japan. They have twice the poverty rate of any other prefect. They’re last in Japan for vegetable consumption,” says Newman. “If you pretend that everything’s great in Okinawa, you are leaving those people behind – you’re exploiting them to sell cookbooks.” “He’s right,” says Nir Barzilai, a longevity researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who has studied Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians in the US and their families. “It’s a real problem.” However, he argues records are fairly reliable in the US. And his team looks at many different documents, including passports, voting records and the ages of family members, to verify their centenarians. His own results do differ from those based on blue zones. Barzilai’s centenariansdidn’t have very healthy lifestyles, for example. “Half of them were overweight or obese, half of them were smoking, half of them weren’t exercising, and very few were vegetarians,” he says. But they were healthy – having onlyhalf the incidence of cardiovasular disease. “They have genes that slow their ageing,” explains Barzilai, who’s working on identifying them. He’s already discovered some 60% have genes that lower their levels of growth hormones in late life. This all suggests that genes, rather than lifestyle, are the secret to becoming a centenarian. Not all species age like humans. Take ocean quahogs (a species of mollusc), rockfish andGreenland sharks, which don’t have an exponentially increased death rate with age. “Our knowledge of the mechanisms of ageing is incomplete,” says Faragher. A key driver of ageing is a process called cell senescence. Cells enter this toxic state as we age, damaging tissue and generating inflammation and disease. But Cox and colleagueshave shownthat you can slow ageing if you manipulate these cells to behave as if they were younger. In 2009, ahugely promising studyshowed the drug rapamycin could make mice live up to 14% longer. A clinical trial on humans has even shown that when elderly people were given a low dose of a rapamycin-like drug for eight weeks, itboosted their immune system, and led to a 50% reduction in infections for a year. Other promising, FDA-approved drugs that can extend the lifespan of animals and lead to greater health and reduced mortality in humans include diabetes medicines such asmetformin,canagliflozinanddapagliflozin. Barzilai, however, stresses that these drugs have only been shown to work in people over 50. If you’re young, or you combine several of these drugs, you may find they cause harm such as reduced muscle mass and testosterone. Similarly, rapamycin can “trigger diabetes, ulcers and prevent wound healing at high doses”, says Cox. Johnson, who takes rapamycin and metformin, acknowledges this. “Metformin has so many effects on the body”, he says. “It may have some kind of effect on muscle to some degree, but it may have a whole bunch of positive effects too.” Another option is to deal with senescent cells by deleting them. Compounds found in many fruits and vegetables, includingdasatinib,navitoclax,quercetinandfisetin, have shown promise in deleting such cells – and are now sold as supplements. Such drugs may also treatdiabetic kidney diseaseandidiopathic pulmonary fibrosisin humans, both caused in part by senescent cells. Faragher has also shown that resveratrol, found in grapes,can reverse cell senescence. But again, senescent cells do some good, too, such as healing wounds, which means it can be risky getting rid of them. We don’t know for sure whether these drugs or supplements will actually help humans live considerably longer. But many longevity enthusiasts including Johnson are already taking them. Faragher, however, doesn’t believe any of this will lead to an “immortality pill”. Rather, these kinds of drugs could be “a bit like antibiotics” – taken during a limited time when you’re ill or ahead of vaccination to enhance the immune system. More experimental techniques exist, but may cause cancer. These include “epigenetic reprogramming” of cells to make them younger and gene therapies aimed at lengthening our telomeres – protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age. But while short telomeres are linked to a short lifespan, long telomeres boost cancer risk. “I’m very hesitant about the telomerase stuff because of the cancer risk, though some newer studies suggest it’s possible to minimise that risk,” says Cox. So where does that leave us? Unfortunately, it appears to be a waiting game. Despite genuinely promising research, a lack of human trials means there’s still noprovenway to live significantly past 100. Researchers also warn against mixing and matching drugs and interventions the way Johnson does. “Each one might buy a little bit of extra time. But if you put them all together, you might do worse rather than better,” says Cox. But Johnson is optimistic. “I’ve arguably got the best biomarkers in the world,” he says, adding that scientists, who “are spending 75% of their time writing grant proposals”, should learn to value the open source data he provides – especially as other people are copying his protocol. Barzilai disagrees, stressing that one self-experimenting individual does not constitute a scientific study. “If Bryan Johnson dies, which I think is possible because he is doing a lot of crazy things together, it will reflect badly on us.”",

You’ve acknowledged that we are a “disputatious people” so I know you will take this response in the spirit in which it is offered. I have relished every book you’ve written since your very first novel,Coming from Behind, was published in 1983. Much of your writing has resonated: your acuity about campus politics, your refusal to disavow, nay your pride, in your particular ethnic version of the Mancunian working class and your fine satirical instincts.  Unlike your first editor, the late Carmen Callil, I don’t object to your “masculinist” point of view. If your special subject seems to be the penis who am I to argue? Howard, in my favourite of all your books,Roots Schmoots, you acknowledge that Our People are “smitten with their own tragedy”. But that tragedy and your smittenness seem to have overwhelmed your capacity for empathy for the other contemporary tragedy – that of the Palestinian right to self-determination and sovereignty. Yourlatest jeremiadargues that antisemitism is the ur-racism, exceptional and eternal. I share your alertness to antisemitism. My mother was regularly called Mrs Goldberg. I said nothing when a chair of a publishing company I led asked whether a P&L statement was “Jewish accounting”. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve watched people tapping the side of their noses to suggest shrewdness, a nose for making a deal. However, I am surprised that “our” tragedy has left you unable to recognise that the occupation has morally corrupted Israeli society, that successive Israeli governments have colluded to oppress Palestinians, destroy their lives, their homes, and ensured the impossibility of any prospect of justice or peace. You suspect the western media of propaganda when, in reality, there has been a remarkable lack of representation of life inGazasince 7 October. I’m not sure where you were last weekend but the epic column inches devoted to the Israeli victims of 7 October does not suggest a failure to give due regard to their suffering. Indeed, what was almost entirely missing, or at best appeared as an afterthought, was any attention to the consequence of that day for Palestinians. This isn’t a call for both-siderism – I take Jacqueline Rose’s (one of your Ashamed Jews) view that “balance is a corrupt term in an unbalanced world”. One should not ignore the horror of theatrocities committed on 7 Octoberin the left-wing kibbutzim that Netanyahu and his cronies assiduously and cynically ignored for the last 15 years, nor should one ignore the nightmare for families who await, with dread, news of loved ones still held hostage in Gaza. But Howard, I wonder how you can push to one side the 40,000-plus Gazans murdered in the last 12 months because you’re preoccupied by what you describe as that most ancient hatred. You write, “it is hateful to be accused of what you haven’t done, but more hateful still to be accused of what you would never dream of doing and what you cannot bear to see done”.I wonder whether perhaps you hadn’t noticed the TikTok efforts of proud IDF soldiers, the religious fundamentalist settlers’ brutal treatment of Palestinians, who Yoav Gallant calls “ human animals”, or the obscene crimes against Palestinians prisoners at Sde Teiman prison in a state that promotes itself as the only democracy in the region. The evidence seems to refute your high-minded idea of Jewish people as incapable of barbarism. You seamlessly conflate Jewish­ness and Israel. I assume for you that connection is obvious as it is for the majority of diaspora Jews. So I assume you don’t mind being held accountable for the actions of the current government, given your essay evidences no dissent. However, if you are uncomfortable with the reality of the Israeli state today, then perhaps you should reconsider your allegiance to Zionism – rather than asking to enjoy your nightly viewing without being exposed to its deadly manifestation in the form of maimed babies, among other things. Almost as ancient as the hatred that preoccupies you is the rhetorical question: will this war on Gaza be good for the Jews? I think not. Louise Adler is a former publisher",
most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/13/melania-trump-memoir-review,,Melania by Melania Trump review - a blame-dodging masterclass | Melania Trump | The Guardian,,"Melania Trump’s eponymously titled memoir is a 180-page exercise in buck-passing and blame-dodging. The former US first lady blames staffers for plagiarizing Michelle Obama; repeatedly stresses her love for her husband despite professing to abhor lying liars who lie; anddeclaresabortion afundamental right, without pausing to considerDonald Trump’s role in attacking it via the US supreme court. Melania is by no means an exhaustive read, but it does leave the reader asking why she has chosen to bare her soul just weeks before theelection. Or whetherKamala Harrismight more accurately channel her policy preferences than her husband, the Republican nominee yet again.  Many subjects are missing. Not surprisingly, Melania has nothing to say about other women in her husband’s life: E Jean Carroll (the woman Donald defamed andsexually assaulted); Stormy Daniels (the adult film star whose hush-money payments led to Donald’s criminalconviction); Karen McDougal (the former Playboy Playmate who alsohad an affairwith Donald). There are less than a handful of passing references to Ivanka, Donald’s oldest daughter who hesaidhe would have dated if she weren’t flesh and blood and who Melania is widelyreportedto loathe. Trump’s children by other women barely get a look-in. Melania does repeatedly say she loves her own son, Barron, and her parents too. True to form, no clue is offered as to who assisted in writing Melania. In contrast toBreaking History, the White House memoir by Jared Kushner, Ivanka’s husband, Melania does not offer acknowledgments. It’s a decent bet someone lent her a hand. Her book does contain 64 pages of photographs. The lead-off is a passport page, stamped on 27 August 1996 at JFK in New York, the day Melania arrived in the US. The final page includes a “digital collectible”, available frommelaniatrump.com. Like her husband, the brand is all. “Financial independence is a core value of mine,” Melania writes. “Melania Timepieces and Jewelry represented my passion, my project and my business – a symbol of independence, self-respect and empowerment for all women.” Understandably, Melania’s takes on policy have received more attention. Without mention ofDobbs v Jackson, the ruling by which a supreme court including three hardliners installed by Donald Trump gutted the constitutional right to abortion and privacy, her stand for personal freedom isfull-throated. “It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,” she thunders. “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.” Simply put, such words jar with her party’s record. And yet, another chapter is more telling still. Melania dumps on staffers for drafting the speech to the 2016 Republican convention in whichshe plagiarized Michelle Obama. Except Melania manages also to point the finger at herself. “During my review of many speeches of previous first ladies, Michelle’s emphasis on the fundamental values of hard work, integrity, and kindness resonated deeply,” she writes, of a conversation with the aide who wrote the speech. In other words, Melania shows she was familiar with Michelle Obama’s 2008 speech to the Democratic convention, portions of which she would repeat to Republicans in Cleveland in 2016. There’s more. Before speaking at the RNC, Melania “rehearsed multiple times with the teleprompter, feeling confident in my delivery”. And yet, she claims, when the plagiarism was noticed and a media firestorm blew up, she was shocked. “Upon closer examination, the undeniable similarities between the two speeches left me reeling.” Really? “I trusted that any and all political and legal vetting had been taken care of, but now I realized that the campaign and RNC had left me on my own.” Talk about throwing the staff under any passing bus. And yet, to quote the deathless words of Kimberly Guilfoyle, Don Jr’s fiancée: “The best is yet to come.” “‘Why was the speech not vetted?’, I asked Donald in frustration … From then on, I realized the importance of being intimately involved with every detail of my public life. No longer would I delegate specific tasks or trust others to ensure my reputation was protected.” Specifically, Melania blames Meredith McIver of the Trump Organization – to whom she says she herself read Michelle Obama’s words, words Melania then repeatedly practiced. As the saying goes, shit rolls downhill. When it comes to her husband, too, Melania is not in the blame game. The chaos ofJanuary 6is dealt with as swiftly as anything inconvenient that actually makes it to her pages. She wags her finger at those who assaulted the Capitol in an attempt to overturn Donald’s 2020 defeat but also claims to have been unaware of events for most of that terrible day. “The violence we witnessed was unequivocally unacceptable,” she writes. But in her next breath, she adds that she “recognized that many individuals felt the election was mishandled and that the vice president should halt the confirmation process”. Naturally, Melania’s take on protests following the murder of George Floyd is far more strident, complete with a condemnation of “the inflammatory rhetoric of Black Lives Matter leaders”. Indeed, she does not expressly name Floyd, the Minneapolis man whose murder by police triggered the long hot protest summer of 2020. As for her husband’s exhortation to the far-right Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” around the election, or his forecast of a “Big protest in DC on January 6th[,] Be there, will be wild!”, or his exhortation to followers to “fight like hell”? Crickets. Almost eight years have passed since Melaniareportedly cried in sorrowon election night 2016, when her husband won the White House. She could yet return. Maybe that will provide enough material for another 180 pages.",Lloyd Green

We share a great emotional connection, but sex has always been a sticking point. I have a lower sex drive; I enjoy thinking about sex as well as masturbating, and I have no difficulty reaching climax, I’m just frequently underwhelmedby sex with my partner.He, on the other hand, says that he feels desire for me and would like to have sex more often. However, he also regularly mentions he finds sex with me routine or disappointing and he would like me to act more enthusiastically. He feels rejected. Recently, we’ve tried to addressit by scheduling date nights, so he doesn’t have to worry about rejection and I don’t have to worry about feeling pressured on other nights – although he has made advances on non-date nights, whichhave contributed to the point I’ve now reached where I can no longer enjoy even non-sexual intimacy. I lovehim deeply, but I don’t know how to get out of this impasse. We’ve tried therapyand he’s said that talking didn’t seem to change things,and doesn’t want to rehash old conversations that don’t help. I’ve written a letter to him and it helped a little, at least it led to us adopting the scheduling system. But it’s too weird to keep writing to someone you live with.  Philippa’s answerIt sounds like the impasse may be that he doesn’t want to talk and you don’t want to have sex. And that if he could talk and listen and understand what page you are on, you might not be so averse to sex and, similarly, if he had all the sex he wanted, he might feel secure enough to talk. This is quite often where couples get stuck. True and lasting love isn’t all about the meeting of physical desires so much as it is about a profound understanding of each other’s vulnerabilities and an acceptance of the imperfections that come with them. Maybe he finds it makes him feel too vulnerable to have conversations about this face to face, so writing to him like you have done is a way forward, weird or not. Sexuality, in its mysterious and elusive nature, is not just about physical pleasure but is tied to our emotional landscape, to the unspoken and often unrecognised layers of our being. You mention a lower sex drive, but also a vibrant inner life where you enjoy thinking about sex, and masturbating. This suggests the issue may not lie in a waning of your sexuality, but in how it has been shaped by the dynamic between you and your partner. Has the expectation that you will be desirous and enthusiastic worn you down? Have you tried to meet his needs and in doing so perhaps started to lose sight of your own? Now, your body is rebelling. InThe Dance of Intimacy, Harriet Lerner describes the dynamic where one partner chases while the other retreats and then the roles reverse as a common and complex pattern in relationships. This “pursuer-distancer” cycle is a way both partners manage anxiety and emotional distance. I see you pursuing him, wanting a deeper emotional connection through talking and he runs away. He then pursues you, wanting the connection through sex, which makes you want to run away. When one partner chases, they may be seeking closeness, reassurance or connection, often driven by a fear of abandonment or emotional disconnection. The partner who retreats, on the other hand, might be feeling overwhelmed, which triggers their need for space or emotional distance. This retreat then increases the anxiety of the pursuer, causing them to chase more intensely which, in turn, makes the other partner retreat even further. This may account for you not tolerating non-sexual touching now. When the roles reverse, the one who was initially distancing may now feel the need for connection, perhaps out of fear of losing the relationship, while the original pursuer may become overwhelmed by the sudden closeness and feel the need for distance. Him not wanting to have any more conversations about it may be his way of displaying this. This push-pull dynamic often reflects deeper fears and unmet needs, which are being expressed through behaviour rather than being directly communicated. Instead of acting out of fear or anxiety, try to communicate directly. For example, if you’re feeling distant and need space, explain it’s not about rejecting him but about taking care of your own emotional wellbeing. The tendency is for us to take for granted the meanings we automatically assign to our partner’s actions or inactions, but these meanings need unpacking. The key to stopping this dance is for both partners to recognise the cycle and intentionally step out of it. And that, I’m sorry for his sake to have to say, means more conversation, which may be easier with an experienced couple’s therapist (cosrt.org.uk).

Three decades after it rose to prominence, the band and its founder, Fred Durst, alleges thatUniversal MusicGroup (UMG) owes more than $200m after fraudulently concealing royalties from the band.  In a lawsuit filed inCalifornia, attorneys representing Durst, Limp Bizkit and Flawless Records accused UMG of using software “deliberately designed to conceal artists’ (including Plaintiffs’) royalties” so it can pocket the profits. UMG is one of the most powerful forces in the global music industry, with a roster spanning from Taylor Swift and Neil Diamond to Dr Dre and Renee Rapp. The company did not respond to multiple invitations tocomment. Limp Bizkit claims it was not paid “a single cent by UMG in any royalties” until taking legal action, despite a “tremendous” resurgence in popularity in recent years, with its songs played hundreds of millions of times on streaming platforms in 2024 alone. The lawsuit, filed in California federal court, claims that many more bands and acts might also be getting shortchanged. Attorneys for Durst, Limp Bizkit and Flawless Records go so far as to suggest that a pre-trial discovery process – in which both sides of a case exchange information – will “show that potentially hundreds of other artists have likewise been wrongfully defrauded regarding their royalties, showing that the system was intentionally designed to commit fraud on Plaintiffs and other artists”. “These accusations are massive,” said Jay Gilbert, a music industry consultant and former executive at UMG and Warner Music Group. He is skeptical. “My gut tells me that this isn’t a systematic scheme to withhold royalties. It’s more of an accounting issue that’s blown up,” Gilbert said. “It sounded pretty damning and pretty heavy-handed, but in my experience, I think it’s something less dramatic.” This lawsuit was “the nuclear option”, added Mark Tavern, who previously worked at record companies including UMG and Sony Music. “I think it’s designed to force a settlement, and make it happen quickly.” “It’s a bit over the top,” said Tavern, who now lectures on the music industry at the University of New Haven. “It can probably be easily explained by bureaucracy, or incompetence,” or the sheer volume of payments processed by a music firm as large as UMG, he said. Durst claims he was told by UMG that he had not received any royalty statements because his account was still so far from recoupment, with executives at the firm suggesting it had paid Limp Bizkit some $43m in advances over the years, according to the lawsuit. When representatives of Durst and Limp Bizkit gained access to UMG’s portal for royalty statements in April, however, they claim to have noticed balances that indicated it owed more than $1m. In August, UMG paid just over $1m to Limp Bizkit and $2.3m to Flawless Records, according to the lawsuit, which says executives blamed the failure to pay sooner on an error with new software. Questions over royalty payments arise “all the time”, according to Gilbert, but rarely explode into the open. “This sort of dirty laundry is not aired commonly,” he said, with issues typically resolved through audits “behind the scenes”. The global music industry has been rapidly transformed over recent decades, first by the rise of downloads, and then by streaming. Finding and listening to songs has never been easier, thanks to hundreds of millions of tracks that stack the libraries of platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. Take Break Stuff by Limp Bizkit. It was first released in May 2000, but you might hear it in passing while watching TV, scrolling through social media, or playing a video game. Gone are the days when you would visit a local record store, go through the racks, find the album, and ultimately listen back to the song. It’s just a few taps away. Even Limp Bizkit’s attorneys acknowledged that the band – which split up in 2006, and reformed in 2009 – had a “relatively quiet period” in the early 2010s. In the lawsuit, however, they claim that interest in the band began to increase “exponentially” around 2017, leading it to sell out arenas and headline festivals. “There is a big pop-punk revival going on,” observed Tavern. “The current generation [of fans] is looking back 20 or 25 years.” Such “heritage” acts and artists, as they are referred to by music industry executives, are prized by record labels. UMG sought Durst’s approval to reissue Limp Bizkit’s 2000 album Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water on vinyl last year, according to the lawsuit, and “repeatedly asked” him to get involved with an anniversary rerelease of Significant Other, another of its albums. To Durst, it seemed like a “money grab”. The complaint alleges that the plaintiffs are still owed much more than they have been paid. Durst, Limp Bizkit and Flawless Records are demanding a jury trial. Their case is already making waves. ​“Everyone is talking about it,” observed Tavern, who noted the complicated nature of calculating music royalties in the streaming era had led to widespread confusion – and, sometimes, suspicion of the industry’s dominant firms. ​ “The way the money gets paid is totally different now, and much more convoluted,” he said. “You can point to 450 million streams, but that is not the same as 450 million records.” Gilbert said: “I think cooler heads will prevail,” suggesting that attorneys for either side would probably meet privately to examine the facts. “This thing will be resolved,” he said. “I think it’s going to go away.”",Callum Jones

AsHurricane Heleneand thenHurricane Miltonhave ravaged much of the south-eastern US in the past two weeks, Trump has sought to pin blame upon Joe Biden’s administration for a ponderous response to the disasters, even suggesting that this was deliberate due to the number of Republican voters affected by the storms.  But former Trump administration officials have said the former president, when in office, initially refused to release federal disaster aid for wildfires in California in 2018, withheld wildfire assistance for Washington state in 2020, and severely restricted emergency relief toPuerto Ricoin the wake of the devastating Hurricane Maria in 2017 because he felt these places were not sufficiently supportive of him. The revelations, first reported uponby E&E News, have raised major doubts over what Trump’s response to disasters would be should he win next month’s presidential election. The former president has already been criticized for his role in spreading misinformation about Helene and Milton that hasallegedly slowed the disaster responseand even led to online death threats against Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) staffand meteorologists. “Trump absolutely didn’t want to give aid toCaliforniaor Puerto Rico purely for partisan politics – because they didn’t vote for him,” said Kevin Carroll, former senior counselor to the homeland security secretary John Kelly during Trump’s term. Carroll said Kelly, later the president’s chief of staff, had to “twist Trump’s arm” to get him to release the federal funding via Fema to these badly hit areas. “It was clear that Trump was entirely self-interested and vengeful towards those he perceived didn’t vote for him,” Carroll told the Guardian. “He even wanted to pull the navy out of Hawaii because they didn’t vote for him. We were appalled – these are American civilians the government is meant to provide for. The idea of withholding aid is antithetical to everything you want from in a leader.” The effort to overcome Trump’s reluctance to provide aid for California succeeded only after the then-president was provided voting data showing that Orange county, heavily damaged by the wildfires, has large numbers of Republican voters, according to Olivia Troye, who was a homeland security adviser to the Trump White House. “We had to sit around and brainstorm a way where he would agree to this because he looked at everything through a political lens,” Troye told the Guardian. “There were instances where disaster declarations would sit on his desk for days, we’d get phone calls all the time on how to speed things up, sometimes we had to get [Vice-President] Mike Pence to weigh in. “It was shocking and appalling to us to see a president of the United States behaving in this way. Basically if it doesn’t benefit him, he’s not interested. We saw this in theCovid pandemictoo, when it was red states versus blue states, and it’s still evident in his demeanor now, where he’s politicizing disaster response. It’s dangerous and reckless.” One of the most “egregious” delays, Troye said, came after Hurricane Maria smashed into Puerto Rico, causing widespread damage and nearly 3,000 deaths.In the wake of the disaster, Trump claimed the death toll had been inflated “to make me look as bad as possible”, called the mayor of San Juan “crazed and incompetent”, and halted billions of dollars of federal support for the island. Ultimately, Fema covered debris cleanup in Puerto Rico, and Trump visited the US territory,throwingpaper towels to hurricane survivors. But not all recovery costs for the island were paid for by the federal government, with an independent inspector generalreportfinding that Fema mismanaged the distribution of aid following Maria. This came just months before Trump agreed to pay 100% of Florida’s costs after the statewas hit by Hurricane Michael. “They love me in the Panhandle,” Trump said, according to an autobiography written by Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor. “I must have won 90% of the vote out there. Huge crowds. What do they need?” While officials around Trump were able to persuade him to relent somewhat in these instances, the former president held firm in refusing to provide disaster relief to Washington after wildfiresravaged the east of the state, largely destroying the communities of Malden and Pine City, in 2020. For months, Trump denied Washington’s request for federal help due to his dislike of Jay Inslee, the state’s Democratic governor and a prominent critic, according to an aide of Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican congresswoman whose district was scorched by wildfires. McMorris Rodgerswrote to Trump to side with himin his dispute with Inslee while pleading with the president to release the funding. “Despite our governor’s bad faith personal vendetta against your administration, people in my district need support, and I implore you to move forward in providing it to those who have been impacted by devastating wildfires in our region,” McMorris Rodgers wrote. Trump, however, did not agree to provide the help, which was only given once Joe Biden came into office. “Trump consciously and maliciously withheld assistance in a fit of juvenile pique because my state had the effrontery to question his policies,” Inslee told the Guardian. “What’s so stunning is that Trump enjoys his authoritarian instincts in refusing to help people. Most human beings would feel guilt in punishing people in pain whose homes are in ashes or are under 8ft of water. It’s a window into the darkness of his soul, frankly. We’ve seen with North Carolina again that he will use natural disasters for his own purposes and his fragile ego. He’s a clear and present danger.” Carroll and Troye, former Trump administration officials, predicted there would be fewer constraints on Trump withholding disaster aid should he win another term in the White House. Several Trump allies, including those who wrote the Project 2025 conservative manifesto, have called for the Republican nominee to root out dissenters and install obedient political apparatchiks within the federal government to help enact his wishes. “Next time you won’t have the integrity of Mike Pence: you’ll have JD Vance who will do whatever Trump wants,” said Troye, who is a Republican but has endorsed Kamala Harris for president. “It’s concerning to think about a future Trump administration with just loyalists in these positions around him in these sort of moments that should be non-partisan. “I hope voters are paying close attention to contrast between the responsible leadership shown by Biden and Harris and the dangerous demeanor of Donald Trump.” Just last month, Trump signaled that his deal-making over disaster aid would not change if he were president again, warning that he would block assistance to California unless the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, agreed to deliver more water to farmers. “Gavin Newscum [Newsom] is going to sign those papers,” Trumpsaidfrom his golf course in California. “If he doesn’t sign those papers, we won’t give him money to put out all his fires, and if we don’t give him the money to put out his fires, he’s got problems.” Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary of the Trump campaign, did not answer questions regarding the allegations made by Carroll and Troye, and instead referenced efforts by Trump to improve forest wildfire management and repeateddebunked claimsthat disaster relief money has been diverted by Fema to migrants. “President Trump visited Georgia twice in one week to tour destruction fromHurricane Heleneand has encouraged his supporters to donate more than $6m for relief efforts on the ground,” she said. “Kamala Harris stole $1bn from Fema to pay for illegal migrant housing and now there’s nothing left for struggling American citizens. President Trump is leading during this tragic moment while, once again, Kamala leaves Americans behind.”",Oliver Milman

Nor is Hamas leading ‘the resistance’ | Kenan Malik | The Guardian,,"‘Israel is not invading Lebanon, it is liberating it.” Soproclaimed France’s pre-eminent liberal philosopherBernard-Henri Lévy as Israeli tanks drove across the border and its war planes bombed villages in the south and residential districts in Beirut. “There are moments in history,” he exulted, when “‘escalation’ becomes a necessity and a virtue.” For Lévy, it is not just Lebanon that Israel is liberating, but much of the Middle East, too. Lévy is not alone in rejoicing at Israel’s spreading military offensive. For many, Israel is waging war, not merely in “self-defence” but, in thewords of president Isaac Herzog, “to save western civilisation, to save the values of western civilisation”,a claim echoedbymany of its supporters. And the destruction of Gaza, of its hospitals and universities, and the killing of 40,000 people? And the 2,000 people killed in Lebanon in a fortnight, and the fifth of its population displaced? Collateral damage en route to saving civilisation.  I should not need to say this but, as it has become commonplace to portray anyone criticising Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon as supporting Hamas or Hezbollah or celebrating the slaughter on 7 October last year, let me say that what Hamas did was barbarous, and that, asI wroteat the time, “Hamas represents a betrayal of Palestinian hopes as well as a threat to Jews”. The same can be said of Hezbollah. And yet, until 7 October 2023, the prime minister of Israel, and much of his government, wasfar more supportive of Hamasthan I was or would ever wish to be. “Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,”Benjamin Netanyahu told a Likud meetingin 2019. “To prevent the option of two states,” observed former Israeli general Gershon Hacohen, who for years backed Netanyahu’s policy, “he is turning Hamas into his closest partner. Openly, Hamas is an enemy.Covertly, it’s an ally.” Israel’s support for Hamas goes back decades, an “attempt to divide and dilute support for a strong, secular PLO by using a competing religious alternative”, as a seniorCIA agent told UPImore than 20 years ago. So successful was this strategy that Hamas swept to power in Gaza in 2006, and the Palestinian Authority was cut in two, with Hamas controlling Gaza and Fatah the West Bank. In recent years,theTimes of Israelobserved, “Israel has allowed suitcases holding millions in Qatari cash to enter Gaza through its crossings since 2018”, while practically turning “a blind eye to the incendiary balloons and rocket fire from Gaza”. On 7 October, it added on the day after the slaughter: “The concept of indirectly strengthening Hamas went up in smoke.” Hamas was responsible for the butchery of 7 October. But Israel had helped nurture it for the explicit aim of denying Palestinians a state. And now, in the attempt to undo its previous work, it has laid Gaza to waste. Israel has to enforce “another Nakba [catastrophe]”, Hacohen insists. “The Gazans have to be expelledfrom their homes for good.” Yet, however cynical it may have been, there was nothing exceptional about Israel’s strategy. For decades, western governments sought to exploit Islam to help pursue their political ends, from the funding of international jihadists to drive out the Red Army in Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion of 1979 to secular Franceencouraging the building of prayer roomsin factories, regarding Islam, in the words of Paul Dijoud, immigration minister in Valéry Giscard d’Estaing’s government, as a “stabilising factor which would turn the faithful from deviance, delinquency, or membership of unions or revolutionary parties”. Such policies often created a space in which more radical Islamist movements could flourish. We are still living with the blowback from this strategy. Netanyahu’s aim in expanding Israel’s wars, and in threatening to turnLebanoninto another Gaza, is not to “liberate” anything or anyone but to maintain control, internally and externally. The lessons of previous invasions of Lebanon – in 1978, 1982 and 2006 – should be clear enough. On the first two occasions, Israel invaded to confront the Palestine Liberation Organisation, on the third to try to eliminate Hezbollah, which had emerged, with Iranian backing, in response to the 1982 invasion and occupation. Each invasion was marked by considerable bloodshed – including, in 1982, the massacre of up to 3,500 Palestinians and Lebanese Shia in two Beirut refugee camps, Sabra and Shatila, by Israel’s allies the Lebanese Christian Phalangist militia – and nothing that anyone could call “liberation”. There is a deeper issue here, too. In modernity, thehistorian Ronald Schechter wrote, “Jews became good to think [with]”, a commentechoed by David Nirenbergwho, in his classic history of “Anti-Judaism”, similarly observed that “modernity thinks with Judaism”. What they meant was that the symbolic roles imposed on Jews became a means of addressing wider social issues. “The ‘Jewish Question’ ”, Nirenberg wrote, is not “simply an attitude towards Jews and their religion, but a way of critically engaging with the world”. This use of “the Jew” as a means of making sense of the world is most true, of course, of antisemitism. For antisemites, belief in mythical Jewish power explains the evils of the world. It is true also of many strands of philosemitism, a term coined originally by antisemites but which has come to be used more widely to describe the views of those who have particular admiration for the Jewish presence in the world. after newsletter promotion And, increasingly, it has become true of perceptions ofIsrael, which, too, has acquired a symbolic status on both sides of the debate. For many of those hostile to Israel, the state has become totemic of many of the ills of the modern world. For supporters of the Jewish state, it is an especially moral nation, carrying the burden of defending civilisation against barbarism. The one view leads to the celebration of Hamas’s murderous assault on 7 October as “resistance”, the other to viewing the destruction of Gaza and the invasion of Lebanon as a necessary defence of western values and of “civilisation”. If 7 October was an act of “resistance”, and if the destruction of Gaza and the brutalisation of Lebanon can be dismissed as essential steps towards a more civilised world, then I suggest we need to rethink what we mean by “resistance” and “civilisation”.

The Labor leader promised a free lunch for everyQueenslandstate primary school student, the day before polls open in the state’s election. It came just a day after he unveiled a policy of state-owned, privately run GP clinics.  But in a rare consensus between theLiberal National partyand Greens, his political opponents agreed he had stolen the minor party’s lunch. Greens MP Amy McMahonintroduced a private members’ motion in 2021calling for the policy, which Labor voted down. Miles said there had been a change since 2021: “I’m premier.” The Labor left leader has spent months distancing himself from his predecessor, Annastacia Palaszczuk. She did not appear at Sunday’s campaign launch and has been rarely seen at party events since she stood down in December last year. “As I’ve said all along, as the premier, I will be doing what matters to Queensland and showing Queenslanders the kinds of things that I’m passionate about and I believe in, and school lunches has been a pretty consistent theme,” Miles said. “Queensland Labor, at the 11th hour, has decided to adopt the Greens plan to expand a free, universal school lunch program in every school,” federal Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather said on Sunday. “And if you want to make sure that we can deliver on this in the future, then you need a Greens MP”. Chandler-Mather claimed Labor had stolen a number of Greens policies, including50 cent fares, an electricity retailer and free school lunches, with the LNP also adopting some, including cheap fares. “Right now, they’re competing on who can announce more greens policies, which is great, and it demonstrates our power”. The deputy LNP leader, Jarrod Bleijie, also accused Miles of pinching from the Greens. “They have pinched a Greens policy that theLabor partyin parliament voted against not long ago,” he said. Under the policy, free healthy school lunches will be available for all state primary school students from prep to year 6. It would begin “next school year”, Miles said. The party argues the policy would save parents about $1,600 per child each year. Miles said long-term studies suggest that universal free school lunches lower social inequality, lift women’s participation in the workforce and help to prevent childhood obesity. An evaluation of similar programs showed a return on investment of 2.5 to seven times their cost, he said. “We all want kids to have the best start in life – and they learn best with full tummies,” Miles said. The policy is expected to cost about $1.4bn. The education announcement comes on the back of a major health pledge on Saturday. Miles on Saturday announced a $365m plan to build 50 new GP clinics, to be offered for use by private doctors, on condition they bulk-bill. Sign up toAfternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion On Sunday, Miles called it the “biggest intervention in primary care of any state or territory ever”. The school lunch program would cost the taxpayer about $1.4bn, according to Labor. With polls opening on Monday and last ballots cast on 26 October, Labor goes to the election well behind the LNP, according to opinion pollsters and the bookies. The party held its official campaign launch at North Lakes Community Centre, a stone’s throw from Miles’ outer suburban electorate. Miles entered to the Chappell Roan song Hot to Trot and exited to Bruce Springsteen’s We Take Care of Our Own, and stood before a gigantic sign reading “doing what matters for Queensland”. He was careful to wear a happy face for the party faithful on Sunday, again selling himself as a daggy suburban dad with a conscience. The premier even performed a live “lunchbox chat”, a staple of his social media, with daughter Bridie, to accompany the school lunch announcement. Journalists were also issued an illustrative lunchbox. But only a smattering of party grandees attended the launch, including party president, Queenslander Wayne Swan, and Peter Beattie, the longest-serving modern Labor premier. Miles refused to answer whether he was disappointed Palaszczuk had stayed away. “All of the former premiers were invited today. They’re all busy people with their own commitments,” he said, adding he was “happy either way”. A series of senior Labor ministers drew a contrast between what they said was a government of bold ideas aimed at the average Queenslander and an opposition running a small-target strategy. Miles took aim at Crisafulli’s recent abandonment of thestate’s legislated renewables strategy. He pointed to remarks by the federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, to argue the shift wasa stalking horse for nuclear power in the state. “Peter Dutton said it himself: the first step to a nuclear state is to elect Crisafulli. That means the first step to stoping nuclear is electing a Miles Labor government,” Miles said.",Andrew Messenger

Some of the unique plants in this rainforest can trace their lineage back 40 or 50m years when the Gondwana supercontinent was breaking apart and Australia was detaching itself from what is now Antarctica.  Take only a few steps from the cool shade and you emerge to something altogether different. Still rainforest, but changing fast. Soil and rocks are exposed and, above, the leafless branches of tall and dead trees let the sunlight strike the forest floor. This is a place packed with threatened species, including the nightcap oak – a true Gondwanan relic that grows nowhere else. On the ground and at the base of the thin-barked trees is charcoal. Five years ago, chunks of this rainforest not evolved to burn, did burn, during what became known as Australia’s black summer bushfires. “It can take a lot of these trees a long time to die. It is a long, slow death,” says Dr Robert Kooyman, an evolutionary ecologist who has spent more than 40 years working and studying the rainforests in and around Nightcap national park in northernNew South Wales. About 73,000 sq km of forest were burned in the east and south of the country during black summer and the fires scorched the habitat of about3 billion native animals. Half of the world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests – a network of 40 parks and reserves – were affected by the fires that were driven by global heating. Fires burned into about 10% of the rainforest in the Nightcap area and affected about 30% of the rainforest’s margin, says Kooyman. Kooyman discovered the nightcap oak in the late 1980s. Unlike Australia’s many eucalypt species, rainforest trees have not evolved to deal with fire. “It burns around the base and it cooks the cambium layer – the live wood – and the bark. It triggers this slow-motion death and you can see the progressive stages here,” he says, pointing to trees in various stages of that slow death. The fires killed about a third of the mature nightcap oaks, he says, leaving 181 behind. Kooyman’s monitoring shows 72 of those are struggling to survive, or have lost their main stem and now persist “as suckers only”. “That one’s on the way out,” says Kooyman, pointing to a nightcap whose bark and stem is split and is covered by fungi. “That one is failing too,” says Kooyman, pointing to another. “And this was a low-intensity burn.” There is smoke in the air from a nearby hazard reduction burn on the day Kooyman takes us to the marked-out plots where he and colleagues are monitoring every post-fire breath, death and revival. Traps made from net and laundry baskets catch and record whatever falls from the canopy; straps called dendrometers measure trunk growth; and then there are recordings of temperature, humidity, light and seed generation, and the state of the soil. “They can shrink before they die,” says Kooyman, pointing to one of the dendrometers. “The theory of negative growth is real – that would drive the economists crazy,” he laughs. As we leave to look at another patch of burnt rainforest, Kooyman yanks a young wattle that’s sprouting. The fires removed the leaf litter on the forest floor, creating a perfect bed for dormant wattle seeds to germinate. They have been growing at an incredible density – as many as 30,000 a hectare (12,100 an acre). “They’ll create a fire influence inside the rainforest,” he says. “If we had a dry season and another fire, there are huge amounts of this vegetation that would explode in flames. That’s the problem. You end up with a fire-prone landscape.” The fires here were followed within months by torrential rain and violent floods that blasted the banks of the rock-strewn creeks and swept away weakened trees and plants. Kooyman used to see platypus here but since the fires, there’s no sign. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion More than once on this day, Kooyman bristles when the word “recovery” comes up. For fire-adapted forests, the word “recovery” might be fair, but not for rainforests, he says. “Let’s not let this terminology overwhelm us. This is not recovery,” he says, pointing to a 2ft-tall sucker growing from the base of a dead trunk. “What we have discovered is that even after almost five years, the trajectory is still in reverse. The impacts are accumulating and it hasn’t stabilised.” “Do we want these forests in the future? Do we log them? Do we have them crisped by climate change, or do we start compensating for what we know is happening and protect them?” The fire that hit Nightcap national park and the neighbouring Whian Whian state conservation area started in late October as a lightning strike and gained momentum as the extreme heat and dry of 2019 was joined by winds. Kooyman is an honorary research fellow at Sydney’s Macquarie University, a researcher at the city’s Royal Botanical Gardens and scientist with Missouri Botanical Gardens programs in west Africa and Madagascar. But he lives less than an hour’s drive from Nightcap and got to his beloved rainforest within days as the ground was still smouldering. “I did find myself, not depressed but, maybe like PTSD working in these impact zones. I’m not inclined to any level of depression, but this has had an impact on me. You catch yourself being a little angrier or shorter [tempered] than usual. “Having never lived through these sorts of events at those scales it takes some adjusting.” Kooyman is 71, but he moves like someone half his age. Several times this morning, he jumps from his four-wheel drive to chainsaw trees that have fallen across the track. “I’m feeling an urgency now and it’s not so much down to my sunset clause,” he says. In a break, he puts his laptop on the bonnet to show some images of his plots. They look like landscape ink drawings of the forest you might hang on your wall. But these delicate strokes are the artefacts of data from laser scans of the parts of the forest he’s been monitoring. The areas that escaped the fire have a dense and continuous canopy shrouding the understory. But the scans taken from areas that burned show a canopy that is barely a canopy at all. Technology is moving fast and Kooyman is excited that new approaches, like LiDAR scanning, could give him answers to questions he has been chasing his whole career. “We’re getting deeper insights into how these rainforest systems work. So I’m excited,” he says. “But the irony is we’re getting better at measuring decline.”",Graham Readfearn

Charles and Queen Camilla will arrive in Australia on 18 October, with stops in Sydney and Canberra during their six-day visit.  The conversation about Australia’s future under the British monarchy has reared its head in light of the visit after a letter from King Charles to the Australian Republic Movement (ARM)was publicly reported this week. In the letter, Charles indicated he would not stand in the way if Australia wished to become a republic. The letter was in response to one sent by the ARM in December 2023, requesting a meeting with the King during his proposed visit to discuss Australia’s future relationship with the UK, and asking him to “consider publicly supporting the will of the Australian people and their desires to move to a republic”. In the reply, which was sent in March, Nathan Ross, assistant private secretary to the King, thanked the group for its “thoughtfulness in writing as you did” and reiterated the King and Queen’s “love and affection for Australia and Australians”. “The King appreciated that you took the time to write and asked me to reply on his behalf,” wrote Ross in the letter, seen by the Guardian. “Please be assured that your views on this matter have been noted very carefully. His Majesty, as a constitutional Monarch, acts on the advice of his Ministers, and whether Australia becomes a republic is, therefore, a matter for the Australian public to decide.” Australiaheld a referendum in 1999on the issue of becoming a republic, in which 54.9% of the country voted against. Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has previously voiced strong support for the country becoming a republic, saying: “Australia should have an Australian as our head of state.” When he took power in 2022,he appointed one of his MPs as assistant minister for the republic, signalling his intent to move towards another referendum. However, Albanese recently indicated that a second referendum was not a priority, and the assistant ministrywas abolished in July. Nathan Hansford, co-chair of ARM, said while the group had thought it was “quite unlikely” the King would agree to their request to support their cause – thereby eliminating himself as head of state in Australia – they wanted to have a respectful conversation about Australia’s future. “It’s up to Australia to decide what they want to do with the head of state. And what better time for us to have a think about that then when the King is here this week.” Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Hansford said according to research conducted by the group, 8% of Australians are “rusted-on monarchists”, 60% of Australians preferred an Australian as head of state and 40% of Australians didn’t even realise that Charles was the country’s head of state. “So we’re hoping that there’s a real conversation-starter, by Charles and Camilla coming here,” he said. “We’re a really unique country, we’re a country with such a long history – tens of thousands of years of Indigenous culture – and with a really multicultural community that’s been growing so much since we had the last referendum in 1999 … and most of us can’t really understand having our head of state as someone who’s born into the role and not selected on their merit. “People are really starting to think: well, is this who we are in 2024 as as a country?” Philip Benwell, national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, said the current system has served Australia well. “Our constitution provides stability and security,” he said. “There’s never been a major crisis with our constitution since 1901 [when Australia federated] … That’s what we are campaigning against, not for the sake of the King or, earlier, the Queen, but because we believe our constitution best protects our democracy in this country because it blocks politicians from total and absolute power.” Benwell said while the ARM had every right to write to Charles requesting a meeting, it would have been a breach of protocol for the King to have accepted their invitation. “The King cannot officially meet with me, just as he cannot officially meet with the republicans, because [the republic question] is an ongoing issue in this country. He’s here to meet the people, not to become involved in political issues, he’s above that as king.”",Kate Lyons
