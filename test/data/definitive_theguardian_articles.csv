James Paterson says Coalition at odds with ‘centre-left’ Biden administration on Middle East ceasefire,,"The opposition home affairs spokesman, James Paterson, is at odds with the US on the need for a ceasefire in Gaza and de-escalation inLebanon. About 2,700 people fleeing conflict in Lebanon have now landed in Australia, as the federal government prepares to start ending flights. A year on from Hamas’ 7 October attack on Israel, fighting has widened in the region from Gaza to Lebanon, Yemen and Iran. The US vice president, Kamala Harris, said her administration was working to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. Asked on ABC Insiders on Sunday about the Coalition’s position on a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, Paterson said that it could only happen when Hezbollah had been “degraded and defeated”. This is at odds with the position of the US president, Joe Biden, and the vice president, Kamala Harris, who have called for a de-escalation and ceasefire. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email When questioned about being in disagreement with the nation’s closest ally, Paterson said Australia was a sovereign country. “It wouldn’t be remarkable for an Australian politician to disagree with an American politician, particularly the United States administration under President Biden and Vice President Harris, a centre-left administration,” he said. “I’m from a centre-right political party, there’ll be times that we disagree, and mature adults can be open and honest.” Paterson said that “on questions of principle, [the Coalition] are very strong supporters of Israel”. “We understand the circumstances they face. God forbid Australia ever faces challenges that Israel faces. God forbid that Australian politicians are ever faced with these choices, but if we would expect their government to respond as decisively as Israel has.” Asked if he wanted to see a ceasefire enforced, Paterson said the opposition wanted to see an end to the conflict. “In my view, that will only happen once Hamas releases the hostages and once Hamas is degraded, so they no longer pose an ongoing threat to Israel from Gaza,” he said. Laborfailed to secure bipartisanship on a motioncommemorating the first anniversary of 7 October, which the assistant trade minister, Tim Ayres, labelled “deeply disappointing”. “The opposition chose to hang out with Adam Bandt [Greens leader] their supposed opponents, the two extremes ofAustralian politicscoming together,” he told Sky News. More than 1,200 Israelis were killed when Hamas launched its attack last year, taking hundreds more hostage. Sign up toMorning Mail Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began its retaliatory strikes, with the majority of Gaza’s population facing displacement and starvation. Interest in free seats out of Beirut has declined sharply in recent days, with fewer than 180 aboard two flights to Cyprus that departed on Friday. The last two government-chartered flights will leave Beirut on Sunday before the Australian government pulls the pin on the evacuation operation. Australians and their family members still in Lebanon will need to resort to local carrier Middle East Airlines or other commercial airlines. One final Qantas flight is due to leave Cyprus on Wednesday evening. The flights followed an escalation in Israel’s year-long scuffle with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in recent weeks, with acampaign of intense bombingsacross Lebanon including its capital Beirut.

Sculpture by the Sea 2024: giant melanoma on Sydney beach to deliver ‘message that will be hard to ignore’,,"Sculpture has a knack of provoking debate. The medium’s ability to divide viewers on the aesthetics of a work – and often itscost to the public purse– can make sculpture a polarising subject. But it’s rare for a work to claim it may save lives. Working in the field of advertising, Sydney creative Andrew Hankin is not above hyperbole. But his team’s entry into this year’sSculptureby the Sea could very well save a life or lives, as visitors to Tamarama gaze down in horror/awe/morbid fascination at a gargantuan sculpture resembling a melanoma. Creator of the enormousWe’re Fryin’ Out Here’frying pan for the 2014 Sculpture by the Sea, Hankin is reprising his skin cancer awareness-through-art project with an inflatable sculpture constructed from heavy-duty fabric. Titled Melanoma, the work will almost imperceptibly change in size, shape and colour as the outdoor exhibition progresses. It may be less lighthearted that his previous work, Hankin acknowledges, but a decade on he felt a more “cutting approach” was needed. “It’s a really big issue, and I think in the sense of bigness, we wanted to go out there and create something that hadn’t been done before in terms of scale,” he says. “It’s going to have a message that will be hard to ignore this summer.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Just how the three-metre-high by 20-metre-wide melanoma will change colour, as well as its shape and size, will remain an artist’s secret. “We almost want people to not recognise that it’s changed at first,” he says. “We want people to feel like, ‘Oh wow, that changed in front of my eyes, and I didn’t really realise it’ … because that almost feels like how you would recognise a melanoma on your own skin.” The creative team of Hankin, Andy Cooke and Matthew Aberline will be joined by Scott Maggs, who founded Skin Check Champions following the death of his closest friend from skin cancer at the age of 26. According to Cancer Council NSW, two out of three Australians will be diagnosed with some type of skin cancer during their lifetime, and Australia is one of the world leaders in skin cancer research and treatment. Early detection of melanomas is critical, Maggs says. “Over 60% of skin cancers are actually identified by the people who had them on their skin. It’s something really important for every Australian to learn, to look out for changes and things that are new.” Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Skin Check Champions provides free early detection services, including to regional and remote communities, and educates people with the “A, B, C, D, E” mantra – A for asymmetry, B for border, C for colour, D for diameter and E for evolution. On the weekend of 26 and 27 October the organisation will be conducting free skin checks for people coming to view the melanoma sculpture on the Tamarama sand. When the exhibition concludes on 4 November, Skin Check Champions will take up a 10-day residency at theBondiSurf Bathers’ life saving club, where it hopes to screen about 2,000 people. The Sculpture by the Sea venture is the second artistic collaboration the not-for-profit is entering into, having partnered with Spencer Tunick for the2022 Bondi beachwork where 2,500 people stripped off not just in the name of art, but also to draw awareness to skin cancer. The costs of both creating the sculpture and staging the mass skin check events are being jointly funded by sunscreen manufacturer La Roche-Posay and pharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb. Now in its 26th year, the world’s largest free-to-the-public outdoor sculpture exhibition opens on 18 October. The 2km coastal walk from Bondi Beach to Tamarama is expected to host almost half a million visitors during the 18-day event. This year will feature the work of a dozen Japanese sculptors, including Haruyuki Uchida, Keizo Ushio and Toshio Iezumi, artists from across Europe and Asia and works by four Australian artists – James Rogers, John Petrie, Stephen King and Paul Bacon – who exhibited in the first Sculpture by the Sea in 1997.",Kelly Burke,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kelly-burke,2024-10-12,headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/oct/13/giant-melanoma-sculpture-by-sea-2024-tamarama-bondi-beach
"‘It has been hell’: cult hero Nedd Brockmann defying the agony in 1,000-mile run for charity",,"On the morning of the final day in Nedd Brockmann’s quest to run 1,000 miles (1,609.3km) in 10 days, the loneliness of Australia’s favourite long distance runner could be felt by all. The former tradie turned endurance athlete was in agony. Brockmann, 25, from the NSW central west, had already covered 1,271.26km in nine days by running 16 hours a day around a 400-metre athletics track at Sydney Olympic Park. He had raised over $1 million in donations for charity. But his body was failing him. The blisters on Brockmann’s feet were raw and bleeding. And despite wearing shoes three sizes too large to combat the discomfort, there were times he could barely walk, let alone run, in his effort to meet the astonishing target of four marathons every day. “It is so relentless that track … it has been hell … and that’s why I love it,” Brockmann told his followers in a social media clip. By then his ‘Uncomfortable Challenge’ had drawn 2.6m views to TikTok for what did prove uncomfortable – yet undoubtedly inspiring – footage. Brockmann captured the hearts of the nation in 2022 with an extraordinary 46-day run of 4,000km across Australia that raised $1.85m forWe Are Mobilise, an outreach program combatting homelessness. Six weeks after he set off in Western Australia, a crowd of over 10,000 people cheered the cult hero across the line at Bondi Beach. This challenge was shorter but steeper – and far more gruelling. Brockmann was targeting the record set by the greatest ultra runner of all time,Yiannis Kouros, who ran 1,000 miles in 10 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes and 36 seconds in New York in 1988. “Yiannis Kouros’s feat of endurance is simply mindblowing,” Brockmann had written on Instagram ahead of setting out. “However, if you’re going to do something, don’t go in half-assed, throw everything at it.

One in 10 Australian parents struggling to afford vaccinations for children,,"One in 10 Australian parents are struggling to afford the costs of vaccinating their children, according to a nationally representative survey conducted earlier this year. Thenational vaccination insights projectsurveyed 2,000 Australian parents of children under five between March and April and found the biggest barrier to turning declining vaccination rates around were the practical difficulties parents face. Dr Katarzyna Bolsewicz, one of the lead investigators of the project which is a collaboration between the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), the University of Sydney and the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, said the project offers the first ever national social and behavioural insights study around vaccination. Bolsewicz presented the early findings from the survey at a NCIRS webinar on Thursday, and a separate presentation based on data from the Australian Immunisation Register showed thesteady decline in childhood immunisation coverage since the start of the pandemichas continued into mid-2024. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Only 90.8% of two-year-olds were fully vaccinated in 2023, a fall from 92.1% in 2020, while only 93.3% of five-years-old in 2023 were fully vaccinated compared with 94.8% in 2020, according to associate professor Frank Beard from the NCIRS. While much of the media attention and popular perception around lagging vaccination rates has focused on vaccine hesitancy and concern, Bolsewicz said “the survey shows those practical barriers are really pronounced”. Of the respondents, 11% said they could not afford the vaccinations, 9.3% found it was not easy to get to an appointment, 8.2% did not prioritise vaccination appointments, while 6% did not not believe vaccines were safe and 5.3% did not believe vaccines were effective. “Even though childhood vaccination under the national immunisation program is supposed to be free of charge, there are other costs,” Bolsewicz said. “If you get a consultation at the same time some GPs will charge a co-payment, or costs associated with taking time off work for parents who are single parents, or the costs related to transport, especially for people living in regional and rural areas.” The survey results, which were weighted for state, regionality and age group, reflected vaccine uptake that was largely representative of current national childhood immunisation rates with 93.5% of respondents saying their children were up to date with their vaccinations, 4.85% partially vaccinated and 1.65% unvaccinated. “This is pretty spot-on nationally,” Prof Margie Danchin, another lead investigator of the project and a paediatrician at the Royal Children’s hospital in Melbourne, said. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The most common barrier parents reported in the survey was 60% said they felt distressed about vaccinating their child and the needle pain. Although people cited fear of needles, the barriers that were most associated with partial vaccination rates compared with the fully vaccinated group were practical access barriers – including affording, prioritising and getting to appointments – were most strongly linked. The barriers were higher among parents who also reported financial stress, Danchin said. The project will involve further research interviewing participants to understand more about the reasons why they could not afford costs or struggled to get to an appointment. Some of the barriers to parents getting to appointments include the inability to take young children under five to a pharmacy for their vaccinations, the lack of pop-up or weekend clinics and besides Victoria, very few free nurse-led immunisation clinics, Danchin said. Beard, who was not involved in the national vaccination insights project, said “regular monitoring of vaccination coverage is important, but it doesn’t tell us why childhood vaccination rates in Australia are declining. It is therefore critical to identify the barriers to vaccination uptake so that we can implement evidence-based approaches to address them”.",Natasha May,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/natasha-may,2024-10-12,headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/one-in-10-australian-parents-struggling-to-afford-vaccinations-for-children
Abortion wasn’t on the Queensland election agenda. So why is it now a threat to the LNP campaign?,,"On front doorsteps in Brisbane’s middle suburbs, Liberal National party candidates campaigning for the upcomingQueenslandelection have started getting questions about abortion. “It’s becoming an issue … in places we thought we might win,” says one party member. Two weeks ago, as the Queensland election campaign began, Labor social media posts suggesting the LNP had a “secret plan” to limit abortion rights and access weredismissed as a scare campaign. The LNP leader,David Crisafulli, says his party has “ruled out” changes to Labor’s 2018 laws that decriminalised abortion. Abortion is, as Crisafulli says, “not a priority” for the LNP. But it has quickly become a problem. What might have started as a last-ditch Labor tactic has now become a mainstream issue, which LNP moderates say is damaging the party’s chances of regaining a footing in more progressive Brisbane electorates. This week the crossbench MP Robbie Katter pledged he would trigger a conscience vote to restrict – and possibly even criminalise – abortion. Crisafulli, whose ticket includes the former Christian right-backed senator Amanda Stoker and other MPs and candidates who are on record opposing abortion, has now been asked about the issue for five straight days. On Wednesday, he batted away 39 separate questions about the issue. Every question gets the same answer. The attempts to deflect are only adding fuel to the fire. Soon after Crisafulli became LNP leader in 2020, he struck a sort of informal stability deal with his party room to put internal fights to one side to bolster the LNP’s chances of taking back government. At the 2020 election, the LNP’s internecine bickering contributed to a weak result. Party members referred to unpopular office bearers – who tried to roll the leader, Deb Frecklington, just weeks before the campaign – as “the cabal”. The party’s identity crisis was writ large in an email from the then president, Cynthia Hardy, who said a review of the 2020 loss would seek to define what the LNP stood for. “What is our raison d’etre?” Hardy asked members. The four-year rebuild has now put the LNP in a position where, according to the polls, it is on the verge of winning government in Queensland. Sources say key to the success has been the informal stability arrangement – MPs from the moderates, conservatives and the Christian right all agreeing to drop their personal crusades and focus on a singular goal. The party found a unifying purpose: beating Labor. “But those divisions are still there, they haven’t gone away” one LNP source says. The shift in the campaign to focus on abortion rights, and the prospect of a conscience vote, serves to highlight those divisions in a way that can cause significant damage to the party, just weeks before voters go to the polls. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The issue is so vexed for the LNP because it divides the party – the majority of its grassroots members, its platform and its MPs – from more progressive views of the electorate. Social reforms such as abortion and voluntary assisted dying have been key to Labor’s electoral success in Queensland, but particularly Brisbane where the LNP holds just four seats. Both of those reforms were progressed cautiously – drafted by the law reform commission and ultimately backed by polling that showed overwhelming support. And Labor has sought to exploit those sorts of social policy debates, knowing they harm the LNP in city areas where the party is eager to re-establish a presence. With the LNP cruising in the polls, moderates had held out hope of beating Labor in middle suburban seats – Ferny Grove, Stafford, Mansfield, Mount Ommaney and Aspley – areas beyond the reach of Greens insurgency, but still places where votes have more “small-l” liberal values. Many of these areas vote for the LNP at local and federal elections but are Labor strongholds in the state parliament. A Labor source says the reality is the state LNP is “way too wacko for Brisbane to stomach”. The added concern for LNP moderates is the potential makeup of the LNP party room after the election, if the party wins regional or city fringe seats but not Brisbane ones. “We need moderates in the next parliament,” one party member says. Party sources say the “Christian soldiers” grouping within the LNP has relatively little influence within the current state parliamentary team. There are really only two hardcore members of the Christian right in the LNP party room – the retiring rightwinger Mark Robinson and the veteran Sunshine Coast MP Fiona Simpson. Others often attributed as being associated with the faction, such as Tim Mander or Christian Rowan, are more neatly aligned with Peter Dutton’s mainstream conservative grouping. But before elections, factions always battle for influence. Robinson is handing his seat to Stoker, the former federal senator and figurehead of the Christian right. Candidates who have won preselection for winnable LNP seats include several who have ahistory of opposing abortion rights, or with links to Pentecostal churches. Particularly concerning to LNP moderates is the recent takeover of a large inner-city party division – and the attempted takeover of another – by the Christian right. The party’s Griffith federal divisional council – covering Queensland’s most progressive federal seat – is now helmed by Alan Baker, a veteran of anti-abortion campaigns in the state. Baker sent apre-election email on party letterheadsaying the government had been “captured by transgender ideology”. “Fringe infiltrators can see an election victory around the corner and are desperate to increase their influence,” an LNP source said at the time Baker won control of the branch. With polls still pointing to a comfortable LNP win, the risk for Crisafulli is that the prospect of a conscience vote – brought about by Katter – serves to highlight internal conflicts that have been paused, rather than solved. The opposition leader won’t say publicly whether he would allow a conscience vote, in line with party convention. The federal MP Colin Boycesaid it would be “extraordinary”not to. Crisafulli’s backers are mostly moderates, and MPs say the opposition has been “remarkably united” during the past term. But they also acknowledge that concern about abortion springs from “legitimate concern about what happens when we get in”. “It’s also difficult because we don’t have a track record to point back to,” the MP says. “We obviously try not to hark back to the Newman years.” In more than three decades, the conservatives have only won one Queensland election. After 2012, the landslide win by Campbell Newman, the LNP quickly became unstuck by factional warfare. The party’s MPs went to war with its organisational wing. The nature of the 2012 landslide also meant the election of new MPs who the party might not have expected to win. A state that voted for Newman, framed as a more moderate Liberal, wound up with a party room that veered more conservative and pushed that agenda in government. Griffith University political scientist and commentator Paul Williams says he expects those sorts of internal issues to come to the fore within 12 months of an LNP election win. “Those things are still there in the background,” he said. LNP figurespredicted Labor attacks about abortionwhen Stoker – who lost her Senate seat in 2022 – was preselected to run in Oodgeroo. Stoker announced herself to the public with a firebrand speech on the Senate floor, describing Queensland’s abortion decriminalisation laws as “barbarism [with] the cloak of civility”. In 2022, she told the Conservative Political Action Conference the Coalition would bein opposition for a “very long time”if it did not focus on conservative social issues. But since being announced as a candidate, Stoker has been uncharacteristically quiet as the LNP attempts to stifle intensifying debate about abortion and other social issues, and instead focus on kitchen-table ones. Her appearances on Sky News and rightwing podcasts and anti-abortion rallies have all been replaced with community breakfasts and visits to small businesses. Asked on Thursday whether she would support changes to Labor’s 2018 abortion laws, Stoker used the party line: “It’s not part of our plan, the LNP has ruled it out.” The LNP’s continued refusal to engage beyond its rehearsed line – that abortion reform is “not part of our plan” – now risks backfiring amid ramping pressure from different sides of the debate. At a pre-election meeting of a conservative Christian group last month, attenders were urged to email, call or speak to candidates and “just ask them the question: how would you vote if abortion came up”. “The fact you say that puts it in their mind that abortion is an election issue,” the forum moderator said. The LNP has not responded to the Australian Christian Lobby’s pre-election survey, which includes questions about abortion. The pro-choice service Children by Choice also sent questions to every state MP asking whether they supported, and would protect, ongoing access to termination of pregnancy. None have responded. “It feels ominous, it’s a scary position,” says Jill McKay, the chief executive officer of Children by Choice. “It’s a very simple question. “We’re not trying to polarise who people vote for, but it is a very deep concern that one of our major political parties is unable to present to Queensland what their policies are. “Women who vote for the LNP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the ALP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the Greens need to access abortion.” LNP sources acknowledge that the Katter plan to bring the issue to the next parliament “fucks us”. “[Crisafulli] needs to come out and say something more definitive,” one party source says. But another warns that sticking to the agreed lines remains the only tactic that could keep the informal stability arrangement in place. “The discipline that this whole campaign has been built on would dissolve in a second,” the source says.",Ben Smee,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-smee,2024-10-12,headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/queensland-election-2024-lnp-abortion-policy-david-crisafulli
Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy says forces are holding positions in Russia’s Kursk region,,"Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday that Russian forces had tried to oust Ukrainian troops from positions in Russia’s Kursk border region, but that Kyiv’s forces were holding their lines.“Russia tried to push back our positions, but we are holding the designated lines,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that its forces had recaptured two villages in the border Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched a mass incursion in August. Zelenskyy has acknowledged that the Ukrainian advance into Kursk was intended to draw Russian troops away from frontline positions in eastern Ukraine. Prosecutors in Donetsk region on Saturday said two people were killed in Russian strikes on villages near Kurakhove. The general staff of Ukraine’s military, in a late evening report, reported 47 clashes in the area around Kurakhove and 27 more in the Pokrovsk sector to the north-west. It follows Russia’s defence ministry on Friday announcing the capture of Ostrivske, a village on a reservoir near the town of Kurakhove, a key Russian target in itsadvance through the Donetskregion. Ukraine has not acknowledged the loss of the village, but military bloggers have reported Russian advances in the area. Ukrainian military recruitment officers have raided restaurants, bars and a concert hall in Kyiv, checking military registration documents and detaining men who are not in compliance. Local media reported Saturday that officers intercepted men leaving a concert by Ukrainian rock band Okean Elzy and some were forcibly detained. It is unusual for such raids to take place in the capital, and reflects Ukraine’s dire need for fresh recruits. Raids also reportedly took place in clubs and restaurants in other cities. All Ukrainian men aged 25-60 are eligible for conscription, and men aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the country. The Kremlin said on Saturday that the Democrat party presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s description of Vladimir Putin as a “murderous dictator” exposed how politicians in Washington sought to impose their views on the world.Peskov’s comments appeared to be in response to Harris’s criticism of a report in a newly released book by US journalist Bob Woodward that Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump, while in office,had sent Covid tests to Russiaat the height of the pandemic. In a radio interview, she described Putin as a “murderous dictator”. Leaders of the group of atomic bomb survivorsawarded the Nobel Peace Prizewarned on Saturday that the risk of nuclear war was rising, renewing their call to abolish nuclear weapons. “The international situation is getting progressively worse, and now wars are being waged as countries threaten the use of nuclear weapons,” said Shigemitsu Tanaka, a survivor of the 1945 US bombing of Nagasaki and co-head of the Nihon Hidankyo group. Vladimir Putin signalled last month that Moscow would consider responding with nuclear weapons if the US and its allies allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range western missiles. Ukraine’s military said on Saturday that it struck a Russian-controlled oil terminal in the partially occupied Luhansk regionthat provides fuel for Russia’s war effort. Russian state media reported that the terminal close to the city of Rovenky had come under attack from a Ukrainian drone and said there were no casualties and that the fire had been extinguished, but did not comment on the extent of any damage. Russian emergency services said they had brought a massive fire under control at the Feodosia oil terminal in Russian-annexed Crimea,which had burned for six days after being struck by Ukraine, state news agency Ria Novosti reported. Russia’s defence ministry said 47 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted and destroyed by its air defence systems overnight into Saturday: 17 over the Krasnodar region, 16 over the Sea of ​​Azov, 12 over the Kursk region and two over the Belgorod region, all of which border Ukraine.

Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy says forces are holding positions in Russia’s Kursk region,,"Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday that Russian forces had tried to oust Ukrainian troops from positions in Russia’s Kursk border region, but that Kyiv’s forces were holding their lines.“Russia tried to push back our positions, but we are holding the designated lines,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that its forces had recaptured two villages in the border Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched a mass incursion in August. Zelenskyy has acknowledged that the Ukrainian advance into Kursk was intended to draw Russian troops away from frontline positions in eastern Ukraine. Prosecutors in Donetsk region on Saturday said two people were killed in Russian strikes on villages near Kurakhove. The general staff of Ukraine’s military, in a late evening report, reported 47 clashes in the area around Kurakhove and 27 more in the Pokrovsk sector to the north-west. It follows Russia’s defence ministry on Friday announcing the capture of Ostrivske, a village on a reservoir near the town of Kurakhove, a key Russian target in itsadvance through the Donetskregion. Ukraine has not acknowledged the loss of the village, but military bloggers have reported Russian advances in the area. Ukrainian military recruitment officers have raided restaurants, bars and a concert hall in Kyiv, checking military registration documents and detaining men who are not in compliance. Local media reported Saturday that officers intercepted men leaving a concert by Ukrainian rock band Okean Elzy and some were forcibly detained. It is unusual for such raids to take place in the capital, and reflects Ukraine’s dire need for fresh recruits. Raids also reportedly took place in clubs and restaurants in other cities. All Ukrainian men aged 25-60 are eligible for conscription, and men aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the country. The Kremlin said on Saturday that the Democrat party presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s description of Vladimir Putin as a “murderous dictator” exposed how politicians in Washington sought to impose their views on the world.Peskov’s comments appeared to be in response to Harris’s criticism of a report in a newly released book by US journalist Bob Woodward that Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump, while in office,had sent Covid tests to Russiaat the height of the pandemic. In a radio interview, she described Putin as a “murderous dictator”. Leaders of the group of atomic bomb survivorsawarded the Nobel Peace Prizewarned on Saturday that the risk of nuclear war was rising, renewing their call to abolish nuclear weapons. “The international situation is getting progressively worse, and now wars are being waged as countries threaten the use of nuclear weapons,” said Shigemitsu Tanaka, a survivor of the 1945 US bombing of Nagasaki and co-head of the Nihon Hidankyo group. Vladimir Putin signalled last month that Moscow would consider responding with nuclear weapons if the US and its allies allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range western missiles. Ukraine’s military said on Saturday that it struck a Russian-controlled oil terminal in the partially occupied Luhansk regionthat provides fuel for Russia’s war effort. Russian state media reported that the terminal close to the city of Rovenky had come under attack from a Ukrainian drone and said there were no casualties and that the fire had been extinguished, but did not comment on the extent of any damage. Russian emergency services said they had brought a massive fire under control at the Feodosia oil terminal in Russian-annexed Crimea,which had burned for six days after being struck by Ukraine, state news agency Ria Novosti reported. Russia’s defence ministry said 47 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted and destroyed by its air defence systems overnight into Saturday: 17 over the Krasnodar region, 16 over the Sea of ​​Azov, 12 over the Kursk region and two over the Belgorod region, all of which border Ukraine.

How Australia’s political parties have split over Israel and Gaza,,"The past year inAustralian politicshas been marked by division over how to respond to the 7 October Hamas attacks and Israel’s assault on Gaza – with no shortage of accusations about who is politicising the conflict. Those divisions came to a head this week when Peter Dutton’s Coalitionrefused to support a parliamentary motionmarking the first anniversary of 7 October because it also included calls for regional de-escalation and a ceasefire. Explore this timeline to find out how the Labor government,Coalitionopposition and Greens have responded to key events over the past 12 months. “Australia unequivocally condemns the attacks on Israel by Hamas including indiscriminate rocket fire on cities and civilians. We call for these attacks to stop and recognise Israel’s right to defend itself. Australia urges the exercise of restraint and protection of civilian lives.” “When people talk about Israel having to show restraint, it’s completely and utterly the wrong time for that sort of language … I think it’s important for us to speak in a bipartisan way, but the Coalition won’t be using any language about restraint from the Israeli people at the moment. Their focus is on defeating this scourge and making sure that they can recover their citizens.” “The premeditated targeting of civilians by Hamas is a war crime, as is the bombing of Palestinian civilians by the State of Israel. All perpetrators of war crimes in this conflict must be held to account for their actions in accordance with international law. The Greens condemn the attacks and we condemn the occupation.” “This was not just an attack on Israel. This was an attack on Jewish people. Let us be clear: Hamas is an enemy, but not just of Israel. Hamas is an enemy of all peace-loving Palestinian people who are left to pay a devastating price for this terrorism. Hamas honours no faith. It serves no cause but terror. It is no better than any other group in history that has clung to the twisted belief that victory can be built on the blood of the innocent … There is no question that Israel has the right to defend itself against a terrorist organisation and to take strong action against it, but we join the calls of President Biden and other partners for Israel to operate by the rules of war.” “The Coalition joins with every other person of decent humanity in condemning this attack by Hamas militants on Israel. Israel has every right to exist. Israel has every right to defend itself and its people. Israel has every right to deter future attacks and other acts of aggression, of coercion and of interference. The Coalition supports, and proudly supports, Israel’s right to do what is necessary and needed in the circumstances, with every asset available to safeguard its sovereignty, to bolster its borders, to protect its people and to thwart the threats it now faces – the existential threats. There must be no restraint shown to those who have shown no restraint themselves in committing these vicious and vile acts of terrorism.” “This looming humanitarian catastrophe is something that Australia should be joining other countries in trying everything we can to stop. We join with everyone in this parliament in mourning the 1,300 Israelis* who have lost their lives, but on today’s count there are also between 2,300 and 2,600 Palestinians who have lost their lives, many of who are children. And we mourn them as well. This is now moving beyond self-defence into an invasion, and it is up to Australia as a peace-loving country to join the push to stop it. No to antisemitism, no to Islamophobia and no to the war on Gaza.” * The Israeli death toll was later updated to be about 1,200 killed “Australia shares the grave concerns that I have articulated previously about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Human suffering is widespread, and it is unacceptable … This is a collective statement about the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire that the world is supporting. So, this is not a unilateral decision by Australia. We made a decision on the basis of the merits of this resolution to join along with many other countries to support the resolution at the General Assembly.” “War is terrible, and I grieve for absolutely every single life that is lost that is an innocent civilian, particularly those of children. But the reality is, if Israel just adopts the ceasefire that Anthony Albanese has now voted for, it will just give Hamas opportunity to re-arm, regroup and repeat. The terrorist atrocities all over again.” “It’s not a ceasefire until the bombs stop dropping. The PM must fight like hell to make this ceasefire call a permanent reality. Not a pause before the slaughter starts again. A genuine, permanent ceasefire.” “Our support for the ICJ and respect for its independence does not mean we accept the premise of South Africa’s case. We will continue to work for a just and enduring peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I would note Australia is not currently a party to the case and that at this stage the ICJ has not invited interventions from other parties.” “The Albanese government should rule out supporting South Africa’s unbalanced application against Israel to the ICJ. Mr Albanese has been wildly inconsistent in the positions his government has taken, with Labor deeply divided. Australia should maintain a strong commitment in support of Israel’s inherent right to self-defence after Hamas’s horrific targeting of civilians, while continuing to expect Israel to act with regard to international law.” “Australia must publicly support South Africa’s genocide case against Israel in the international court of justice. The world is watching and Australians are demanding that Anthony Albanese put politics aside, show some guts and be remembered on the right side of history.” “Australia is deeply concerned by allegations Unrwa staff may have been involved in the abhorrent October 7 terror attacks. We welcome Unrwa’s immediate response, including terminating contracts and launching an investigation, as well as its recent announcement of a full investigation into allegations against the organisation.” “If she’s knowingly sent that money to a terrorist organisation, then I think that is an outrage, and I think Penny Wong and the prime minister have more questions than answers in relation to this particular issue.” “The Labor government’s blatant hypocrisy is on full display – suspending funding to Unrwa while Palestinians are being killed, starved and displaced, but not so much as a slap on the wrist for Israel which is on a genocidal mission.” “People would have seen the footage of the vehicle that was hit in this strike by an Israeli missile that clearly is identified as being from the World Central Kitchen. These vehicles were going about carrying the best of humanity, people who’d come from all over the world to help Palestinians who are suffering from extraordinary deprivation in Gaza. And for them to lose their life in these circumstances is outrageous and completely unacceptable. Humanitarian workers are protected under international law. And the Netanyahu government must publish a full and transparent investigation. And they must be held accountable.” “This is a tragedy. It shouldn’t have happened. It is wrong that it happened. We’ve been very clear about that. We have expectations in terms of the investigations that should occur. But we also cannot turn away or be so naive as to pretend that tragedies and mistakes don’t occur in war. They do. They happen all the time. It’s a terrible thing. We’d wish it wasn’t the case.” “Israel’s targeting of a clearly identified convoy of aid workers is just one example of their attacks and undermining of aid agencies and workers. Just a phone call simply isn’t good enough. The Australian government must respond with actions, not words.” “We all know one vote won’t, on its own, end this conflict. It has spanned our entire lifetimes. But we all have to do what we can to build momentum towards peace. I want to be extremely clear again. This vote is not about whether Australia recognises Palestine. We will do that when we think the time is right. What we would say, and what I do say, is Australia no longer believes that recognition can only come at the end of a peace process. It could occur as part of a peace process. I have been clear there is no role for Hamas in a future Palestinian state.” “The Albanese Labor government has proven overnight that they lack the courage to stand against pressure and by sound principles after voting at the United Nations General Assembly for a resolution granting a unique form of UN membership to the ‘State of Palestine’. Labor’s support for the resolution sends a shameful message that violence and terrorism get results ahead of negotiation and diplomacy.” “While the rest of the world moves towards recognising the State of Palestine, Labor’s refusal just sets us back. Recognising Palestine won’t by itself stop the slaughter in Rafah, the invasion, or the occupation; but it is an important step towards peace, equality and justice.” “Well, I’m not about to go into hypotheticals about things that have not happened … There’s been an application. There’s been no determination by the ICC against any individual or anybody at this point in time.” “I don’t rule it out [Australia withdrawing from the ICC] but I think the pressure at the moment needs to be for like-minded countries that share our values, to stand shoulder-to-shoulder, for there to be no difference, and to put pressure on the ICC, to make sure that this antisemitic stance that they’ve taken does not advance.” “Australia must publicly support the ICC prosecutor’s bold decision to press for arrests. No one is above the law … What we do here matters. Labor cannot follow Joe Biden’s flagrant disregard for the independent court.” “If people are coming in from that war zone and we’re uncertain about identity or their allegiances – Hamas is a listed terrorist organisation, they’ve just committed an atrocity against the Jewish people, the biggest attack on people of Jewish faith since the Holocaust – and that the government wouldn’t be conducting checks? I don’t think people should be coming in from that war zone at all at the moment. It’s not prudent to do so, and I think it puts our national security at risk.” “There was a time when the Liberal party would have seen people fleeing, whether they were fleeing Ukraine, Israel, Syria, Vietnam, or Gaza at the moment, and would have had some understanding that this was the worst time to try to malign a whole group of people who are suffering enormously. It’s something that we see on our TV screens every night. This morning, if you turned on the radio, the latest hit was a school in Gaza, with real people devastated and losing their lives. When it comes to security processes, we have faith in our intelligence agencies.” “Frankly, we were in a position where we were wanting to be able to vote for a resolution which did reflect closely the ICJ opinion, which gave impetus to a pathway to peace, and we worked very hard in New York with others, including the Palestinian delegation, to seek amendments that would enable us to support it, as we did the recognition vote and the ceasefire vote, where text enabled Australia to support it, and we were disappointed that the amendments that we and many others sought were not accepted. For that reason we abstained.” “They should have voted with the United States … I think Penny Wong here is – and along with the prime minister, frankly – damaging our relationship very significantly with Israel, with the United States and with like-minded partners.” “The Labor government has shown itself to be gutless fence-sitters by abstaining on a vote in the UN for Israel to end its occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. That is just plain cowardly.” “A year on from October 7, Israelis and people across the world are mourning those who were robbed of their lives and futures and waiting anxiously for news of the hostages who remain in captivity. Palestinians are mourning the lives taken from them in the continuing aftermath. So much has been lost; so many loved ones buried. We join all of them in their grief.” “So in the motion moved by the prime minister today are not just words of comfort and words of recognition in relation to October 7 – and I acknowledge those words in his motion. But of course, it goes beyond that, and it’s an extension of the way in which the prime minister has conducted the debate and himself over the course of the last 12 months, trying to please all people in this debate.” “We condemned the taking of hostages a year ago and we continue to condemn hostage-taking for the war crime that it is. The very same commitment to compassion, honesty, peace and justice required of us in response to those attacks of Hamas requires us as Greens to call out the war crimes and genocide that is being carried out by the State of Israel right now in Gaza and the rest of the occupied territories and the bombing and invasion of Lebanon.” Daniel Hurst is Guardian Australia’s foreign affairs and defence correspondent",Daniel Hurst,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-hurst,2024-10-12,headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/how-australias-political-parties-have-split-over-israel-and-gaza
China cracks down on Communist party officials for reading banned books,,"When Lam Wing-kee ran his bookshop in Hong Kong, filled with controversial and political titles banned in mainlandChina, many of his customers were Chinese Communist party officials. Back then, in the early years of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s reign, and before Lam was detainedby Chinese authoritiesfor his work, the officials would load up boxes of books on CCP politics, Chinese economics, and scandal, often taking them back over the border. “CCP officials would look for books about what’s going on in China, about changes in the top rank officials, who gets the most power, changes in the power and the struggle between them, etcetera,” Lam tells the Guardian, suggesting officials were often buying the books to learn about what was going on inside their own party. “Some of my customers were high-ranking members of the CCP,” he said. But today, such purchases are coming back to bite their buyers. Several recent corruption cases against CCP officials have included accusations of procuring or reading banned materials. The officials have so far received internal disciplinary actions, including being expelled from the party, but observers are watching to see if criminal charges follow. In September a former municipal level official in Heilongjiang, Li Bin, accused of corruption, was also found to have “privately read an illegal publication containing contents that undermined the unity and solidarity of the Party”, according to state media. He was expelled from the Party and his case given to prosecutors. That same month, Cheng Zhiyi, former party secretary of Chongqing’s Jiangjin district, was also expelled. Among the accusations were “losing ideals and beliefs” after he privately read books and magazines with “serious political problems’ while “outside the country”. Henan official Yang Lei also was accused of “losing ideals and beliefs and abandoning the original mission” when he violated “political discipline and national laws”, including bringing prohibited books into the country, according to CCTV in August. A recent report by the South China Morning Postsaidat least a dozen cases this year had prominently included accusations of reading or procuring banned materials, up from seven last year. They emphasise illicit reading ahead of other crimes like bribery. Wen-ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, attributes the rush of punishments to new performance targets for party discipline bureaucrats tasked with “punishing those who are deemed disparaging of the party’s image, principles, or policies, as well as those who are in possession of material that could have such effect.” “The Chinese Communist party champions itself as always ‘great, glorious, and correct’. This image of infallibility must not be challenged, lest it threatens the governing legitimacy of the party,” he said. None of the corruption cases publicly reveal what reading materials the fallen cadres had accessed. But a list of banned titlespublishedby China Digital Times offers some possibilities. The list includes writings on Chinese politics and history, including the Tiananmen Square massacre and the disastrous Mao-era policies that saw millions die from famine, violence, and political purges. There are books scrutinising the modern CCP’s politics and power, or sharing the views of political enemies and critics like Hong Kong tycoon and activist Jimmy Lai, the exiled Tibetan Dalai Lama, and Bo Xilai, the fallen political foe of Xi Jinping. Hillary Clinton’s memoir is on the list, as is Machiavelli’s The Prince, and Hannah Arendt’s The History of Totalitarianism. Many of the banned books line the shelves of Lam’s new shop in downtown Taipei, which hereopenedin 2020 afterfleeing to the Taiwanese capital in exile. Xi’s leadership has been particularly noteworthy for its purges of political rivals and crushing of factionalism. Discussion, criticism, even gossip, has become more and more dangerous for those trying to survive politically. As Xi’s grip tightens, it will be interesting to see if the illicit reading cases move beyond Party disciplinary proceedings and start to attract criminal charges, says law Prof Margaret Lewis, of Seton Hall University. “It’s not like in the past people would be like ‘I’ll just take an unauthorised biography of Bo Xilai down the coffee shop’. But it’s a matter of turning up the temperature, not totally changing the climate” says Lewis. “But it goes to show the power of information and books. They care enough to say this is punishable infraction.”",Helen Davidson,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-davidson,2024-10-12,headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/china-communist-party-banned-books-rules-xi-jinping
Scottish DJ Jack Revill AKA Jackmaster dies aged 38,,"The Scottish DJ and producer Jack Revill, known to many asJackmaster, has died aged 38, his family has announced. Revill died in Ibiza on Saturday morning after “complications arising from an accidental head injury”, his family said. A statement said: “It is with profound sorrow that we confirm the untimely passing of Jack Revill, known to many as Jackmaster. “Jack tragically died in Ibiza on the morning of October 12, following complications arising from an accidental head injury. “His family – Kate, Sean and Johnny – are utterly heartbroken. “While deeply touched by the overwhelming support from friends, colleagues, and fans, the family kindly requests privacy as they navigate the immense grief of this devastating loss.” Born in Glasgow, Revill worked at the well-known record shop Rubadub in Glasgow, and went on to become the co-founder of the record label Numbers. He had recently released the single Nitro, featuring Kid Enigma, telling Electronic Groove music magazine: “It was about feeling hyped and inspired in the club. “Sadly, those moments are rare now. Blame the phones and people who don’t dance. “I am so grateful for my fans, but I got into music because I love dancing. It’s a lost art form at the moment, I think.” The electronic duo Disclosure were among those paying tribute, writing on Instagram: “Can’t believe this. Heart broken. Thank you for all the amazing memories & inspiration Jack. This is just awful awful awful.” A post from the official Instagram account of DU duo CamelPhat on Revill’s Instagram page said: “Can’t believe what I’m reading… in an industry full of Ego you were hands down one of the nicest fellas we ever met along the way. Our thoughts are with family & friends. RIP my friend x”.",,,2024-10-12,headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/12/scottish-dj-jack-revill-aka-jackmaster-dies-aged-38
Trump campaign worked with Musk’s X to keep leaked JD Vance file off platform,,"Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports. The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet his running mate that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist,the New York Times has reported. X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform. The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them. Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that had been hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point, Trump hadsaidhe hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files. The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party. Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan. Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”. Klippenstein, whose X account was restored following the New York Times reporting, said in aSubstack post on Fridaythat Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”. “The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote. “Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.” Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania.",Oliver Milman,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/oliver-milman,2024-10-12,headlines,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/x-twitter-jd-vance-leaked-file

"They are relics of the Gondwana age but five years after Australia’s black summer these trees are dying a ‘long, slow death’",,"Thousands of years of accumulated leaf fall makes the ground bounce like a mattress underfoot and, high above, rainforest coachwood trees form a dense canopy that dresses the understory in permanent shade. Some of the unique plants in this rainforest can trace their lineage back 40 or 50m years when the Gondwana supercontinent was breaking apart and Australia was detaching itself from what is now Antarctica. Take only a few steps from the cool shade and you emerge to something altogether different. Still rainforest, but changing fast. Soil and rocks are exposed and, above, the leafless branches of tall and dead trees let the sunlight strike the forest floor. This is a place packed with threatened species, including the nightcap oak – a true Gondwanan relic that grows nowhere else. On the ground and at the base of the thin-barked trees is charcoal. Five years ago, chunks of this in rainforest not evolved to burn, did burn, during what became known as Australia’s black summer bushfires. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “It can take a lot of these trees a long time to die. It is a long, slow death,” says Dr Robert Kooyman, an evolutionary ecologist who has spent more than 40 years working and studying the rainforests in and around Nightcap national park in northernNew South Wales. About 73,000 sq km of forest were burned in the east and south of the country during black summer and the fires scorched the habitat of about 3 billion native animals. Half of the world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests – a network of 40 parks and reserves – were affected by the fires that were driven by global heating. Fires burned into about 10% of the rainforest in the Nightcap area and affected about 30% of the rainforest’s margin, says Kooyman. Kooyman discovered the nightcap oak in the late 1980s. Unlike Australia’s many eucalypt species, rainforest trees have not evolved to deal with fire. “It burns around the base and it cooks the cambium layer – the live wood – and the bark. It triggers this slow-motion death and you can see the progressive stages here,” he says, pointing to trees in various stages of that slow death. The fires killed about a third of the mature nightcap oaks, he says, leaving 181 behind. Kooyman’s monitoring shows 72 of those are struggling to survive, or have lost their main stem and now persist “as suckers only”. “That one’s on the way out,” says Kooyman, pointing to a nightcap whose bark and stem is split and is covered by fungi. “That one is failing too,” says Kooyman, pointing to another. “And this was a low-intensity burn.” There is smoke in the air from a nearby hazard reduction burn on the day Kooyman takes us to the marked-out plots where he and colleagues are monitoring every post-fire breath, death and revival. Traps made from net and laundry baskets catch and record whatever falls from the canopy; straps called dendrometers measure trunk growth; and then there are recordings of temperature, humidity, light and seed generation, and the state of the soil. “They can shrink before they die,” says Kooyman, pointing to one of the dendrometers. “The theory of negative growth is real – that would drive the economists crazy,” he laughs. As we leave to look at another patch of burnt rainforest, Kooyman yanks a young wattle that’s sprouting. The fires removed the leaf litter on the forest floor, creating a perfect bed for dormant wattle seeds to germinate. They have been growing at an incredible density – as many as 30,000 a hectare (12,100 an acre). “They’ll create a fire influence inside the rainforest,” he says. “If we had a dry season and another fire, there are huge amounts of this vegetation that would explode in flames. That’s the problem. You end up with a fire-prone landscape.” The fires here were followed within months by torrential rain and violent floods that blasted the banks of the rock-strewn creeks and swept away weakened trees and plants. Kooyman used to see platypus here but since the fires, there’s no sign. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion More than once on this day, Kooyman bristles when the word “recovery” comes up. For fire-adapted forests, the word “recovery” might be fair, but not for rainforests, he says. “Let’s not let this terminology overwhelm us. This is not recovery,” he says, pointing to a 2ft-tall sucker growing from the base of a dead trunk. “What we have discovered is that even after almost five years, the trajectory is still in reverse. The impacts are accumulating and it hasn’t stabilised.” “Do we want these forests in the future? Do we log them? Do we have them crisped by climate change, or do we start compensating for what we know is happening and protect them?” The fire that hit Nightcap national park and the neighbouring Whian Whian state conservation area started in late October as a lightning strike and gained momentum as the extreme heat and dry of 2019 was joined by winds. Kooyman is an honorary research fellow at Sydney’s Macquarie University, a researcher at the city’s Royal Botanical Gardens and scientist with Missouri Botanical Gardens programs in west Africa and Madagascar. But he lives less than an hour’s drive from Nightcap and got to his beloved rainforest within days as the ground was still smouldering. “I did find myself, not depressed but, maybe like PTSD working in these impact zones. I’m not inclined to any level of depression, but this has had an impact on me. You catch yourself being a little angrier or shorter [tempered] than usual. “Having never lived through these sorts of events at those scales it takes some adjusting.” Kooyman is 71, but he moves like someone half his age. Several times this morning, he jumps from his four-wheel drive to chainsaw trees that have fallen across the track. “I’m feeling an urgency now and it’s not so much down to my sunset clause,” he says. In a break, he puts his laptop on the bonnet to show some images of his plots. They look like landscape ink drawings of the forest you might hang on your wall. But these delicate strokes are the artefacts of data from laser scans of the parts of the forest he’s been monitoring. The areas that escaped the fire have a dense and continuous canopy shrouding the understory. But the scans taken from areas that burned show a canopy that is barely a canopy at all.

What can the voice’s failure and the past teach us about how Australia can be a nation that embraces progress?,,"By rights, the referendum to grant the nation’s First Peoples meaningful recognition should have been embraced by the Australian people. Instead,they saidyeah, nah. And now we are stuck in a political purgatory. The voice proposal had been decades, some might say more than a century, in the making.It was born in the ashesof the decision by the former prime minister John Howard, backed by the Mark Latham-led ALP, to abolish the flawed but retrievable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Without Atsic’s input, theNorthern Territory interventionsoon followed, then the former prime minister Tony Abbott’sdemolition of Indigenous programs. It is little wonder that older First Nations people, who had lived with the consequences of bad policy all their lives, wanted a way of being assured that their families would not always be subject to political whim in a nation where race-baiting is a go-to political tool. They and their advisers thought – wrongly, as it turned out – that the Australian people would be more empathetic than their political leaders. In the land ofyeah, nah,change is hard won. Many welcomedthe boldness of victorious prime minister Anthony Albanese’s promise to implement the Uluru statement from the heart “in full”. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads We then watched with increasing concern as he failed to build more robust foundations for the undoubtedly difficult task of constitutional change. Rather than explaining how the voice would not only respond to an entreaty, butbenefit all of us – how it would correct historical wrongs and provide a pathway forward, by building bipartisan support, or introducing legislation that would put muscle on the bones of an idea – the first memorable event was a photo op with the towering Americanbasketballer Shaquille O’Neal. Not Patty Mills or Ash Barty, not Adam Goodes or Johnathan Thurston, not Deborah Mailman, Ernie Dingo or Evonne Goolagong Cawley – stars Australians know and admire. Stars for whom it was personal. If you are going to put a match to your political capital, you need to make sure,as Tim Walz says, that the fire is so big that something better emerges, like a phoenix from the ashes. Instead, as the embers of the uncontrolled burn still spark, we are stuck in retreat. Nothing substantial has happened for First Nations people, the republic has been jettisoned, and the consequences of inequality at home and geopolitical uncertainty escalate. It’s not helped by an opposition leader who channels his inner toddler to saynahto everything despite parental reasoning. To give him the right of veto by demanding bipartisan support for any initiative is a recipe for sinking deeper into the mud. These are complex problems. Resolving them demands hard work and analytical, rhetorical and political skill. And imagination, informed by a knowledge of history. Those in Canberra work hard, are analytical and politically tactical, but miss on the other markers.The prime minister was mistakenwhen he saidthere was nothing to be gained by raking over the ashes of the referendum. There are lessons to be learned from its failure and from the past on how to turn the land ofyeah, nahinto a nation that embraces meaningful progress. When in 1889 the New South Wales governor Lord Carrington challenged premier Henry Parkes tocreate a single nation from the six antipodean colonies, Parkes thought it could be done within a year. It took 11, and two referenda in each colony beforeyeah, nahbecamenah, yeah. By then Parkes was dead. We tend to downplay federation and ignore its lessons. But earnest debate across the continent proceeded for a decade. It showed how persistence, argument and a willingness to compromise could produce results.

Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Saturday morning after newsletter promotion For more than a decade after 1901, even with the race-based policies we now reject, Australia was otherwise a global poster child for democratic innovation. Politicians, thinkers and journalists took the long sea journey and then travelled extensively to see what lessons could be learned and applied elsewhere. Universal franchise, living wages, pensions for menandwomen, compulsory free secular education. Recapturing that sense of possibility is what we now need. Prof George Williams’ proposal for a standing constitutional commission, outlinedin his book People Powerco-written with David Hume, is a good place to start. In the spirit of the 21st century this can no longer be left to constitutional lawyers and former politicians but must embrace the nascent models of democratic reform – deliberative democracy, citizen juries, community and internet-enabled consultation – as well as regular conventions and parliamentary feedback. Make it exciting, inclusive and transformative, informed by but not captive to political parties. A standing commission that reaches wide and builds its own authority. Political leaders and academics like to point to the Australian Electoral Commissionas a model for best practice democracy, and it does an admirable job, although many Australians are still remarkably ignorant about the political system. To transform Australia there is a need for more energy, more engagement and education, less room for ignorance and prejudice. An energetic constitutional commission could do this – appealing like the Uluru statement directly to the Australian people. It is unconscionable to think Australia should be constrained indefinitely by a 19th century document. A nation without meaningful recognition of the First Peoples and subservient to the Crown; a place where embracing a bill of rights and equal political opportunities for dual citizens, are off the table. Anah, yeahethos ready to embrace change would make this a much more exciting, prosperous, independent, and inclusive nation, a better fit for the troubled 21st century. Like federation, it will need leaders and people willing to dream.

‘I feel hope’: chance of release dawns for Menéndez brothers in 35-year-old case,,"When theLos Angelesdistrict attorney announced last week his office would review new evidence in the Menéndez case, it marked the first time in decades that the brothers had any hope of a release. Erik and Lyle Menéndez have been in prison since their 1996 conviction in the killings of their parents, José and Kitty, in 1989. The fatal shooting of a prominent entertainment executive and his wife in Beverly Hills, at the hands of their own children, captured international attention three decades ago – their first trial was televised by Court TV – and has reached a new generation thanks to social media and numerous TV dramas and documentaries. The brothers have long denied the prosecution’s claims that they were driven by greed and a desire to inherit a multimillion-dollar fortune, and argued that they killed their parents in self-defense after years of sexual, physical and psychological abuse by their father. Earlier this month, George Gascón, the LA district attorney, said his office would review new evidence and decide whether the case should be considered for resentencing or a new trial. The new evidence includes a letter written by Erik Menéndez that his attorneys say corroborates the allegations that he had been sexually abused by his father as well as allegations from a former member of the boy band Menudo who said that José Menéndez, previously an executive at RCA records, had sexually abused him. The issue is not whether the brothers killed their parents, but their degree of culpability, Gascón said. “We have not decided on the outcome,” Gascón said at a press conference last week. “We are reviewing the information, but I think it’s also important that we recognize that both men and women can be the victims of sexual assault.” In August 1989, Lyle and Erik, then 21 and 18, shot their parents with shotguns multiple times as the couple was eating ice cream and watching television in their Beverly Hills mansion. The killings were so violent, police suspected it could have been connected to organized crime, theLos Angeles Timesreported. About six months later, police arrested the brothers, who prosecutors said went on a major spending spree in the wake of the killings. They were charged with first-degree murder. At their first trial, they testified that their mother had done nothing to stop their father’s abuse and that they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent them from telling anyone about the abuse. The trial included testimony from family members corroborating their abuse allegations and anexpert witnessfor the defense who found the allegations valid and an “originating cause” in the crime. Jurors were unable to reach a verdict, resulting in a mistrial, but at a second trial in 1996, in which testimony about the abuse allegations was limited, they were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In the years since, the brothers have beenreunitedin prison, where they have earned college degrees and served as mentors and caregivers, wrote Kim Kardashian, who has met the brothers, in a recentessayadvocating for their release. A slew of documentaries and TV shows helped keep the story in the public eye. During the pandemic, the case was highlighted in viral TikToks that helped bring it into the spotlight for a much younger audience. The killings were the subject of a Ryan Murphy show released last month (which was criticized by the Menéndez family), which Murphy has said was inspired by content creators who had taken up the cause, critisizing media coverage of the case and advocating for the brothers’ release. “There are thousands of TikToks from young people, specifically young women, talking about the Lyle and Erik case,” Murphysaidat an event last month. “I was blown away because it seemed so current to them.” Tray Gober, a Texas trial lawyer who previously worked with the New York-based Innocence Project, said social media has been pivotal to the case. “Social media has played a crucial role in keeping the Menéndez brothers’ case in the public eye, captivating public interest and putting political pressure on the district attorney to re-examine the evidence,” he argued. The brothers have expressed gratitude and support for the movement online. “The followers who are younger that are on that sort of TikTok social media generation, they really have tremendous hope,” Lyle Menéndez said, according to theHollywood Reporter. “I feel more hope when society seems to be understanding these experiences and sex abuse better.” Erik Menéndez has warned against minimizing their crimes. “This tragedy has been deep, and every member of my family has been impacted. And sometimes I think a lot of that pain and tragedy gets lost in translation in some of the TikTok videos,” he said, according to the outlet. “So I think that it is important that we remember that two people are no longer alive and families have been devastated by this tragedy, and that I am at the center of it. I am the one responsible. I don’t want that to be diminished or minimized in any way by people that support me and believe in me.” Now, for the first time since their convictions, the brothers have a chance at being released from prison. The district attorney’s office has received intense interest in the case nationally in recent weeks following the release of a new documentary and the TV show, Gascón said. The district attorney has received petitions from the brothers asking for a resentencing as well as a review of the new evidence, which includes a letter sent to a family member before the killings in which Erik Menéndez talked about being a victim of molestation, Gascón said, adding: “None of this information has been confirmed.” “We have a moral and an ethical obligation to to review what is being presented to us and make a determination,” he said. “Whether they deserve to be resentenced even though they were clearly the murderers, because they have been in prison for 35 years and have paid back their dues to society, or whether habeas is appropriate if there was evidence that was not presented to the court at that time and had [it] been perhaps a jury would have come to a different conclusion.” Sensitivity to sexual abuse has changed, Gascón toldCNN, and a jury today would likely look at this case very differently. “There is no question they committed the killing. The question is to what degree of culpability should they be held accountable to given the totality of the circumstance,” he said. Neama Rahmani, the president of West Coast Trial Lawyers and a former federal prosecutor, told theoutletthat a resentencing seemed like the best option. “I believe that Erik and Lyle were abused and they should be released,” he said. “If [Gascón] agrees to a resentencing in the interest of justice, I think that’s the clearest path for the brothers.” Gober said the brothers could also be granted a new trial, in which a jury could examine the new evidence, or a plea deal, perhaps to a lesser charge, that would allow them to be released with time served. “It’s also important to note that many individuals who don’t receive as much attention won’t have the same opportunity for their cases to be re-examined,” he said. “For every Menéndez brother, there are 10 more inmates who never got this kind of publicity, and they will die in prison.”",Dani Anguiano,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dani-anguiano,,news-extra,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/menendez-brothers-renewed-interest
From frat-bro media to Kamala Harris: how the sex podcast Call Her Daddy reached the stratosphere,,"According to Spotify, Alex Cooper’s podcast Call Her Daddy is the second-most-listened-to podcastin the world, behind only The Joe Rogan Experience and with averydifferent audience. While the audience for Rogan’s health advice and anti-woke politics skews heavily male, Cooper’s podcast of girls’ room secrets, dating stories and therapy-like disclosures is listened to by young, sex-positive women. Cooper, who turned 30 this year,invites guests such as Katy Perry, Heidi Klum and Miley Cyrus to dress down (most appear on the podcast clad in sweatsuits and baseball caps) and share intimate details of their sexual and psychological lives. Cooper’s honesty is wildly popular and profitable; in 2021, she inked a $60m deal with Spotify, one of the biggest ever for a podcast at the time. In August, she signed a new dealworth more than doublethat, leaving Spotify for a $125m three-year offer from the US radio company SiriusXM. The big money hasn’t dulled the sexual content. A recent sampling of episode titles reads like 1970s Cosmopolitan cover lines: Narcissists, Blow Jobs, and Red Flags; Getting Older, Hotter, and Wiser; and I Made Out with My Boyfriend’s Mistress. So regular listeners may have been to surprised to hearKamala Harrissit down opposite Cooper on the podcast this week, not least because Cooper herself had promised not to sully her sex-positive show with staged political appearances. In February, she told theNew York Timesshe had shut down conversations with the White House. “Go on CNN, go on Fox,” she said at the time. “You want to talk about your sex life, Joe [Biden]?” Weeks before the election, Cooper has had a change of heart. “At the end of the day, I couldn’t see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I’m not a part of it,” she explained on air, reflecting how central she sees herself to female pop culture in the US. For Harris, the decision to go on such an explicit podcast might seem risque, but politically it makes perfect sense. Not only does Call Her Daddy have huge reach among young women, but because Cooper has kept politics away from her public image, experts suspect that her audience might be a well of untapped, undecided voters, too. “Everyone I know has at least tuned into a Call Her Daddy episode,” said Jessica Siles, the deputy press secretary of the gen Z-led non-profit Voters of Tomorrow. “It’s not a news show; it’s a lifestyle podcast, and those are the exact sort of people who need Harris’s message more than others. She’s reaching an audience that she hasn’t met before, who might align with her on some of the issues, but need a little bit of a push to turn out.” The show had a different tone from previous episodes. Harris didn’t get any questions about sex positions or bachelorette parties. Instead the conversation mainly focused on reproductive health, women’s rights and the vice-president’s family life. Though Cooper switched out her trademark sweatpants for what can best be described as gen Z business casual (black stiletto boots, black wide leg jeans, and a hooded sweatshirt branded with “Unwell”, the name of her media company), the interview still read as comfy, with Harris fielding mostly safe questions. The standout moment came when Harris shot back at Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ recent comments about Harris’s lack of biological children. (The Arkansas governor said: “My kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble.”) “I don’t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble. Two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life, and children in their life.” But it wasn’t all stump speech. Harris chatted about being friends with Kerstin Emhoff, her husband Doug’s ex-wife and mother to Harris’s stepchildren, Ella and Cole: “Family comes in many forms … This is not the 1950s any more.” Cooper opened the episode with a disclaimer, suggesting her interview was not necessarily an endorsement of Harris: “I am so aware I have a very mixed audience when it comes to politics,” she said. “So please hear me when I say my goal today is not to change your political affiliation.” But Cooper does come with political baggage. A former ad sales representative, she started Call Her Daddy with her roommate, Sofia Franklyn, in 2018, as a forum for what theydubbed“female locker room talk”. The podcast was quickly picked up by Barstool Sports, a media company known for its blog covering sports, pop culture and viral moments. Barstool’s owner, Dave Portnoy, is an archetypical frat boy with a history of making misogynistic and racist remarks. The journalist Matthew Walther coined the term “Barstool conservatism” to describe the political leanings of the young men who read Barstool and hold libertarian, but socially conservative, views. When faced with accusations of misogyny and toxic workplace practices, Portnoy held up Call Her Daddy as a marquee name and proof the company wasn’t only appealing to young misogynist men. “I gave two girls their own radio show. We have hired girl after girl – they say it’s a great place to work,”he saidat the time. But that love didn’t last: in the summer of 2020, Call Her Daddy went dark. After weeks of silence, Portnoy said the hosts and Barstool were involved in a contract dispute, with Cooper agreeing to go on with Barstool but Franklyn unwilling to agree to the terms. Hecalledthe hosts “unprofessional, disloyal, and greedy” and said Barstool lost $100,000 with every missed episode. This fracture ultimately caused a split between the hosts, and Cooper continued without Franklyn. Cooperparted with Barstoola year later, when the Spotify deal came through. Messiness aside, Cooper’s initial association with Portnoy might explain why, even if she has socially liberal values, she remains associated with a type of fratty, more conservative listener – the kinds of girls who might date guys who read Barstool and maybe even vote for Donald Trump. Sign up toThe Stakes — US Election Edition The Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential election after newsletter promotion Jeri Steinmetz and Ciara Parsons are cousins who host a rival comedic conversation podcast, Ladies & Tangents. (Tagline: “Think sleepover but we all have mental health disorders.”) The pair say many lifestyle podcasters start out non-partisan to avoid controversy, but it’s tough to stay that way in a hyper-political world. “We’re women, mothers, and these issues directly affect us and our fans. So we did start speaking out, and I think that’s what happened here with Call Her Daddy,” Steinmetz said. Cooper, who declined a request for comment, seemed to expect backlash to the episode, and got it from all sides. Some listeners wished she would stay out of politics. Others wanted her to be tougher on Harris. Some questioned the optics of Harris doing the interview so soon after the devastation of Hurricane Helene. “So cool! Kamala sits down for a podcast as a fourth of the country is underwater,” one Instagram user wrote in a comment on the podcast’s page. “She can’t hold a press conference but can go on podcasts lol,” said another. Newsweekreported that the show and Cooper herself lost “thousands” of Instagram followers after the episode dropped. ButCooper’s reach remains phenomenal as traditional news outlets hemorrhage audiences, and she’s become an avatar for a generation that’s more likely to learn about headlines through a TikTok or Instagram reel. Varietyreportedthat musicians who appear on her show see a boost on music streaming apps – even ones who are celebrities on their own, such as John Mayer (who saw streams jump by 350%) and John Legend (200%).Voguegave lavish coverage to Cooper’s “intimate beachside wedding” to the producer Matt Kaplan, which took place on Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula. Though Call Her Daddy has matured in recent years, becoming as much about mental health as it is about masturbation, it’s been tough for Cooper to shake her reputation of, as the New York Times put it, “an evangelist of feminine raunch”. She’s become so synonymous with the world of women’s media that Netflix’s new romantic comedy series Nobody Wants This name-drops her as a rival to its main character, a blonde sex-podcast host played by Kristen Bell. Harris is not the first candidate to use a buzzy entertainment show to try to reach younger voters. Barack Obama wooed millennials by appearing on Zach Galifianakis’s YouTube show and Bill Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show. But Rebeca Damico, a 21-year-old public relations specialist and avid Call Her Daddy Fan from Salt Lake City, says this was a more revealing encounter. She felt she learned more about Harris through this interview than in last month’s presidential debate. “I watched the debate, and it was way more comical than informational,” she said. “Call Her Daddy did a good job at humanizing Harris, and it was cool to see her not even as a politician, but as a woman.” In the spirit of fairness, Cooper said she had invited Trump on the show to counter Harris’s points. He has yet to respond. “That would be such a fascinating episode,” said Siles, the Voters of Tomorrow press secretary. “To be honest, I’m not sure I believe Donald Trump knows what a pap smear is. So to go on a show about women’s issues would be entertaining, at least.”",Alaina Demopoulos,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alaina-demopoulos,,spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/call-her-daddy-kamala-harris-alex-cooper
‘It’s just crazy’: the retired Cornish builder making thousands from his whale paintings,,"A year ago, art gallery owner Tabby Booth was scrolling through eBay when a painting of a whale caught her eye. “I wasn’t even browsing for work,” said Booth, who set up the Sailors Jail gallery in Falmouth,Cornwall, with her husband, James Heslip, in 2023. “It was just for my own interest. But there was something about these whale pictures that felt really special, and the artist was from Newquay. “Our USP as a gallery is to promote Cornish artists so we decided to go and visit him.” They found Steve Camps ensconced in his workshop overlooking the surfer’s paradise of Fistral beach, a retired former builder sitting at the centre of what Booth described as an “Aladdin’s cave” of old picture frames, vintage art and whale paintings. They took away 15 of his distinctive, deceptively simple paintings and put them on sale in the gallery, ranging from £20 for the smaller ones to £100 for the largest. Camps was delighted; he had been happy enough with the few quid he’d got for selling a handful of unsigned pictures online. But the best was yet to come. “Within a week the paintings had all gone,” said Booth. “We had to get more from him, and we knew we had to put the prices up.” A year later, people can’t get enough of Camps’s whales. He does a drop of new paintings about once a month to Sailors Jail, which exclusively sells his work for about £2,500 a piece. Booth now acts as his agent. By the time last weekend’s batch had been hung in the gallery and priced, they had all sold online and had to be taken down again. Camps is slightly flummoxed by it all, not least by the prices his paintings are fetching. It’s a decent unexpected pension, to say the least, for a man who had never put brush to canvas before he retired. “I think I’ve had about £140,000 so far,” he said, sounding as if he hardly believes it himself. Camps has no formal art training. He left school at 16 to become a painter and decorator, and later became a builder, working around Newquay, which he did until retirement. In fact, he’d never even shown an interest in painting. “I suppose I’ve always been a bit of a collector,” he said. “Stamps, things like that, but I never really found the thing that grabbed me until I found some old paintings by a local artist, and bought them on the spur of the moment.” Camps slowly amassed a collection of largely unknown artists, sometimes selling them on through local auction houses, more often just keeping and restoring the frames in his workshop. When he retired at the beginning of last year, he and his partner, Sue, embarked upon a series of coach holidays across the UK. In Llandudno, north Wales, he saw two paintings in the window of a charity shop. “They were quite unusual in style,” he said. “They were ships, they must have been whaling ships, because there were whales on the back of them.” The pictures stirred something in Camps, and when he got home he sat down in his workshop and started to paint. He didn’t even have any proper art materials or paint. “I just used normal emulsion, which I still do,” he said. “I was quite pleased with the results and decided to put them in the vintage frames I had, and stuck them on eBay with some other paintings I’d bought. I think I made about £120, which I was more than happy with.” Last month’s pay cheque for his art was in the region of £20,000, with paintings selling across the world, especially in the US. Camps, who has three children and three grandchildren said: “It’s just crazy. I honestly can’t get my head around it.” Booth is, of course, equally delighted. “He’s basically an authentic outsider artist, with no training, no connections in the art world,” she said. “His work has naiveté and character. There’s a very folk art feel about it, a whimsical element. And he frames each piece himself with one of his vintage frames, which adds to the uniqueness.” From Camps’s workshop, he can see picturesque Fistral beach, the waves dotted with surfers. And perhaps, on the Atlantic horizon, the odd whale, for inspiration? “I’ve never seen a real whale in my life,” he said. “We went on a bit of a cruise from Falmouth once and there were meant to be whales out at sea, but we never spotted any.”",David Barnett,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidbarnett,,spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/oct/12/retired-cornish-builder-whale-paintings-steve-camp

"A week in a swing state taught me a lot about the Maga cult, and gave me hope for Kamala Harris",,"To attend a Trump rally in rural America makes you worry for humanity’s future. After six hours in the baking sun watching 60,000-plus Trump supporters lap up his lies, I am here to tell you that there are few more lowering experiences to be had in modern politics. But it isn’t all we have, and there is much of a positive nature to report from the US, including aninspiring interventionfrom Barack Obama last week and the truth that the Democrat candidate for presidency, Kamala Harris, is conducting a very good campaign indeed. Given that she’s had just three months to pick her running mate, coordinate strategy and key messaging, and confront a wretchedly divided nation, she’s performing with grace and steadiness, while the campaign has united around building a coalition with disaffected Republicans and conservatives of conscience who were in Congress or the Trump administration. For the first time since July, when Harris became the Democrat candidate, theNew York Times/Siena College pollshows her leading Trumpby three points, 49-46. In the average maintained byThe Hillwebsite she is showing a lead of 3.4. Sure, both are within the margin of error and the contest in the seven swing states is much tighter, but the trends are in her favour. She is improving on the key issues of economy and migration and is becoming the candidate of change. A persistent Maga attack line over the last months was that she was too scared, ignorant or dumb to do interviews. She answered it by sitting down with Alex Cooper’sCallHer Daddypodcast, giving a fascinatinginterview to Howard Stern’s radio show, sharing a beer with Stephen Colbert on his late-night show, and announcing, on Whoopi Goldberg’sThe Viewthat, if she won,Medicare would pay for home care. Finally, she faced the remorseless Bill Whitaker in the60 Minutesinterview, an October ordeal for presidential candidates for the last 50 years. She carried herself well and was never less than poised.As I wrote in this paper, I once spent a few hours with her at a social event and liked her a lot but, after seeing those five shows, I feel a duty to note that she can be extraordinarily slippery when it comes to answering questions. Yet she is abiding by all the rules of the democratic game, unlike Donald Trump who refuses to engage in the process and tours his own rallies, ranting and lying, and looking somehow more lumpen and angrier than ever before. Naturally, hepulled out of the60 Minutesinterview, first saying that he didn’t want to be fact checked, then demanding an apology from his previous interviewer Lesley Stahl for something she hadn’t done. There was a fuss about the edit of the Harris programme, which Maga claimed showed the vice-president in a favourable light – it didn’t – but before that got traction the news moved on with two newspaper articles. TheNew York Timesran a story loggingTrump’s mental decline, then, seemingly to prove its point, Trump took himself to the swing state of Michigan last Thursday andtrashed the city of Detroitin a speech to, yes, the Detroit Economic Club. TheWashington Postpublished exclusives from Bob Woodward’s new bookWarthat revealed thatTrump sent Covid tests to Putinand had spoken to him from Mar-a-Lago, the country club where he was alleged to have kept stolen secret documents in a bathroom. The mostdelightful revelationwas a quote from Republican senator Lindsey Graham. “Going to Mar-a-Lago is like being in North Korea. Everybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.” One further positive note. Harris has pulled in over $1bn in campaign donations and is outspending Trump on social media, which is smart because 16 million young people have joined the electorate since 2020.Latest figures showshe’s spent $57m with Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, to Trump’s $6m, and on Google, owner of YouTube, $31.5m compared with Trump’s $9.3m. I spent the week in the state of Pennsylvania, which is the epicentre of the race because it has 19 electoral college votes – the most of any swing state. If a candidate wins by just a handful of individual ballots, he or she will take all the state’s 19 electoral college votes, and probably go on to win the White House. The race is effectively tied and both candidates are putting enormous effort into the state. Trump appeared there twice last week, most theatrically at a big rally in the western town of Butler, 35 miles from Pittsburgh, and where he was winged by a would-be assassin three months ago. It was atriumphant return, with much fanfare and many turns and speakers, including JD Vance and a goofy-looking Elon Musk in “dark” Maga cap. Halfway between a revivalist meeting and a country fair, the event told me a lot about the Maga cult but nothing about politics or Trump’s plans (Project 2025is never mentioned). However, I did establish the truth of rumours that hundreds of people leave his rallies as soon as he starts speaking. Last Wednesday, the splendidly principled conservative politician Liz Cheney, who appeared briefly with Harris on60 Minutesafter endorsing her, hosted a session at Glenside, Pennsylvania, with three female former staffers in the Trump White House who provided insights into Trump’s character and the chaos he brought to every issue and situation. This was peripheral to the main campaign but the impact of coherent and respectedRepublicansspeaking against Trump may bring critical votes to Harris. Every vote matters. “Don’t boo,” Obama routinely says, “Vote!” Sign up toObserved Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion Obama made his first appearance for Harris in Pittsburgh, last Thursday, reclaiming the territory in western Pennsylvania from the Trump rally five days before. The speech was among the best he’s ever given, ranking among his appeals to the American public during the 2008 presidential campaign and the wonderful acceptance speech I saw him make in Chicago. Heteased Trump remorselessly, mocking his lies, the obsession with money, power and status and his “concepts of a plan”. He imagined Trump doing something normal like changing a tyre or a nappy. Someone in the audience shouted out, “his own”. Obama smiled and said he’d thought of that joke but resisted the temptation. This drives Trump and Maga to distraction because, like all those with fascist leanings, they cannot stand people making fun of them. Humour will be an important weapon in the next 23 days because the Democrats need to get under his skin and provoke him to show his truly toxic, bullying nature. Obama’s speech was important for its moral indignation, and it may just be the start of national rejection of Trump’s lies, a kind of have-you-no-sense-of-decency moment that recalls the time in 1954 when a lawyer namedJoseph Welch stood up to Joe McCarthyand ended his communist witch-hunt. It could be that Trump and Maga have overreached themselves with their lies about emergency funding afterHurricane Heleneripped through the south-west causing destruction and hundreds of deaths; in one case a family of 11 was wiped out in a mudslide. According to Obama: “Donald Trump just started making up stories about the Biden administration withholding aid from Republican areas and siphoning off aid to give to immigrants… you’ve got a guy who lies to score political points. I want to ask Republicans out there, when did that become OK? Why would we go along with that?” Obama is practically the only person in America who has the moral authority to make this speech. He and his wife, Michelle, are still the most popular and trusted public figures in the country. Republicans will listen to him because, despite the last nine years, ideas of decency and service still have a potent appeal here. What do I think will happen? I agree with the Democrat activist I met in Philadelphia who said: “We’re winning, but we haven’t won yet.” It’s all to play for and in Harris theDemocratshave an authentic and tireless candidate who would do the best job she could in the White House. But let me just warn that even if she wins on 5 November, Trump will not accept defeat. There is evidence that Republicans are building a case to challenge the result by manipulating the late polls in his favour so that any Democrat victory looks like a steal. There will be months of dispute, agonising waits and, I am afraid, intolerable anxiety for us all. But, as Obama says: “We gotta keep hoping.” Henry Porter is a writer and journalist specialising in liberty and civil rights",Henry Porter,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/henryporter,2024-10-12,spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/12/a-week-in-a-swing-state-taught-me-a-lot-about-the-maga-cult-and-gave-me-hope-for-kamala-harris-pennsylvania
"David Gilmour review – astonishing, goosebump-inducing solos",,"The 78-year-old Pink Floyd veteranDavid Gilmourhas had a busy few weeks. He’s been promoting his first solo album since 2015,Luck and Strange,with shows booked for Rome, LA and New York. He’s cashed out the rights to Pink Floyd’s name, likeness and albums for a share of $400m, wisely keeping the publishing – so he’ll still get paid for covers of the songs he wrote. There have been shots fired at ex-bandmate Roger Waters (“I tend to steer clear of people who actively support genocidal and autocratic dictators like Putin,” Gilmourremarked drily); a surprise appearance during his youngest offspring Romany’s set in a Brighton pub. And a more unexpected collaboration with rapper Ice-T’s heavy metal outfit Body Count on a vicious version of Floyd classic Comfortably Numb. Perhaps one day he’ll return the favour and cover Body Count’s KKK Bitch. Gilmour may not be prolific but he’s never lazy, and has long been attentive to the needs of other musicians, from the days when he tried to help ailingPink Floydfounder Syd Barrett start a solo career after being sacked by the band. Gilmour knows that in another timeline things could have been very different. It’s why his latest album, played almost in full tonight, has “luck” in its title. A lucky boy, born at a lucky time. He skulks out on to the Albert Hall’s stage with hardly anyone noticing. Then, spotlit by a single white light, he begins the lambent guitar lines of 5AM, the prelude to his previous albumRattle That Lock. With the cheapest seats weighing in at £85, and anything decent about twice that, the crowd consists mostly of fans who grew up with Gilmour’s music. Any younger faces are accompanied by someone twice their age. So once the initial roars of recognition have died down, it’s a reverential, near-silent reception, closer to a theatre performance than Pink Floyd’s 1966 Double Giant Freak-Out All Night Raves at the Camden Roundhouse. Dressed in shadowy colours, hunched over the six strings that have given him everything, Gilmour stands stock still as his fingers dance across the fretboard. His playing is so liquid, fulsome and lyrical it takes a while to process that he’s completely unaccompanied. All night, the sound is sensational, powerful and judiciously balanced – if obviously a little skewed towards the guitars. As the band fills out over the next few songs, the crowd relax a little and begin to enjoy the giddy excitement of sharing space with their hero. Like many of the new songs, Black Cat and Luck and Strange feel even more bluesy played live under Gilmour’s weathered yet reasonably powerful voice. The show’s first set is excellent, with several visits toThe Dark Side of the Moongreeted by mini-ovations and an unexpected amount of air drumming. Romany emerges with a Celtic harp for their lead vocal on Gilmour’s lovely version of the Montgolfier Brothers cult classicBetween Two Points. A lightly folky version of Wish You Were Here is superb, and even lesser Pink Floyd songs such as Marooned and Fat Old Sun are delivered with a vehemence much less fragile than their earlier incarnations, all three guitarists playing off each other alongside the three-woman choir, keys and piano also filling out the sound. The first half ends with a brilliant version of High Hopes, with giant white balls appearing to emerge from the video screen into the auditorium and bouncing happily around the audience, right up to a beautiful coda. The interval is nearly half an hour, though, and kills the gig’s momentum. A Great Day for Freedom and In Any Tongue, placed together, become lugubrious downers, and it increasingly feels as if each song is just marking time until it gets to Gilmour’s solo. The Great Gig in the Sky offers the underused choir a moment in the spotlight, but as the show enters its third hour some of the more elderly patrons are no longer hiding their yawns. Gilmour’s tribute to Floyd keyboardist Rick Wright, A Boat Lies Waiting, is simply brilliant, a wonderfully emotional peak, but ending on three songs fromLuckand Strangeis a misjudgment. Thankfully, you can end a main set however you like if you have the unimpeachable genius of Comfortably Numb for an encore, and – though, alas, there’s no sign of Ice-T – Gilmour gives us two more astonishing, goosebump-swelling solos, says his goodbyes and slips away.

Could Aboriginal-designed housing help solve the health crisis in remote communities?,,"It’s hotter inside than out in many of the homes in the remoteNorthern Territorytown of Tennant Creek, where the Warumungu man Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla and his family live. Most lack insulation and guttering. At Drive-in Camp outside town, the homes are tin sheds, disconnected from services since the 2007 intervention but still occupied. The poor housing is making the residents sick, Jupurrurla says: “I worry about the future – will my grandchildren and their kids be living in prison-like houses? Or are we going to start designing homes that allow us to practise our culture?” A $1bn investment in remote housing in the NT since 2017 has failed to solve the problem. A further $4bn was pledged in March in a joint announcement by the federal and Territory governments. But health experts warn that unless authorities commit to a dramatic shift in the way housing is designed and built for Indigenous communities, public health outcomes could worsen. Poor housing has been blamed for high rates of rheumatic heart disease in the NT. The preventable condition is caused by repeated, untreated streptococcus A infections and is linked to poverty, overcrowded and inadequate housing and lack of access to healthcare. Australia has one of the highest rates of RHD in the world, and rates have doubled between 2012 and 2021. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Jupurrurla says community participation in decision-making leads to better maintenance and a sense of ownership. He is the chair of Wilya Janta, a cultural consultancy and housing collective based in Tennant Creek which has developed housing designs by Aboriginal people for Aboriginal people. “For too long, we’ve been given houses we had no say in designing,” he says. Simon Quilty, a GP based in Tennant Creek, also works with Wilya Janta. He says nothing symbolises the failure of government housing design more clearly than steel trapdoors. These were introduced about five years ago to accommodate future air conditioning installations. But instead of providing relief from the heat they act as conductors, turning homes into ovens. “If you can’t afford an aircon, then you’ll have a heat-conducting steel plate making you need that aircon even more than if you did have the money to buy one,” Quilty says. “It is madness, these design lunacies make houses more expensive to build and injure the wellbeing of the resident for no possible gain, to save a few measly bucks.” Glenn Platt, the executive director of strategy and innovation at Emergent Group, says the metal trapdoor is like “having an extra glass window in the room”. The result is a home which is hotter inside than out, a significant health risk when temperatures are frequently above 40C. Overcrowded and poorly ventilated housing is a major driver of preventable diseases among Aboriginal communities, with more than half of all Indigenous people in the NT living in overcrowded homes. Dr John Paterson, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT, says poor housing contributes to the spread of infectious diseases, hampers early childhood development, affects mental health, and diminishes social and emotional wellbeing. “Diseases like rheumatic heart disease are better termed diseases of poverty; driven by overcrowded housing, lack of access to washing facilities and palatable drinking water that is unfortunately too common in remote communities, particularly in the central region,” he says. Overcrowded environments increase the chances of repeated exposure to streptococcus bacteria. While harmless on the skin’s surface or easily managed by antibiotics in communities with good access to health services, repeat infections can lead to immune reactions that scar heart valves. “We’re asking for the same basic human rights which include the same building standards, the same building repair and maintenance expectations, the same basic functions of a house – like access to suitable drinking water and a continuous power supply – that people living in any other jurisdiction in Australia take for granted,” Paterson says. “But for too long these standards have not been met in remote communities.” Most government-built homes in remote areas are built using concrete blocks. They have inadequate thermal efficiency, poor ventilation and minimal climate control. The new housing funding will pay for up to 2,700 new three-bedroom homes over 10 years. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese,said the program was designed to halve overcrowding in Indigenous communities in the NTas part of the Closing the Gap goals. Some 971 new or replacement homes have been built and 489 expanded under other funding deals since 2017. A federal Department ofHousingspokesperson said the new builds would be constructed after consultation with Indigenous communities and Aboriginal Housing NT. Skye Thompson, AHNT’s chief executive, told Guardian Australia that the new homes must be appropriate for the climate and culture of those living in them. “When houses are built to a lower standard of energy efficiency and works are not subject to a proper certification process; when they are poorly oriented, too hot or stuffy; and when the design doesn’t suit the residents’ family configuration or culture, the return on investment nosedives,” she says. The NT minister for housing construction, Bill Yan, said the new Country Liberal party government, whichswept to victory in Auguston a platform that included reversing youth justice reforms andlowering the age of criminal responsibility to 10, reaffirmed the NT government’s commitment to the $4bn housing partnership with the federal government. “The partnership with the federal government is a signed agreement that the new government will honour,” he said. “Territorians living in safe housing is an important part to community safety as well as enjoying our Territory lifestyle,. “We will listen to stakeholders and communities on their housing needs and consider expert advice on any issues prohibiting effective and efficient delivery of remote housing.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter",Otis Filley,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/otis-filley,2024-10-12,spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/could-aboriginal-designed-housing-help-solve-the-health-crisis-in-remote-communities
Melissa Leong: ‘The weirdest thing I’ve done for love? Live on an abbatoir’,,"You’re a judge on this year’s Dessert Masters. What are you secretly the master of? I am the master of dodging a question. I feel like the last couple of years have been a good time to flex my media training. You don’t always want to, as human beings, share everything of who you are. I feel like I can say what I want to say, but keep a little bit for myself. And I think that’s something we should all be good at doing: holding a little bit back for ourselves and our loved ones. What is the most memorable dessert you have ever eaten? An experimental dessert I had in Slovenia a couple of years ago by Ana Roš at Hiša Franko in the Soča Valley. She was working on a dessert that involved beef fat ice-cream. Being in rural Slovenia, it was all about finding interesting ways to use everything she has available to her. And that wasn’t a finished dish. There was a little bit of graininess still involved in the churning of the beef fat into ice-cream, but it was delicious nonetheless. There’s aChef’s Tableabout her from a couple of years ago. If you had a sandwich named after you, what would be in it? If I think about the sandwich I really want to eat right now, it’s marinated artichoke, mortadella, sopressa, fontina; I’m thinking pickled Italian vegetable deli roll. One of the best sandwiches I’ve ever had in my entire life is amuffuletta. I had it from Central Grocery, which is the originator of it in New Orleans. When I went to order the sandwich I said: “One sandwich.” And the guy just looked at me like I was insane. When he gave me the sandwich, I realised why – it’s the entire loaf, so it feeds about six people. I was just travelling with one other person, and over the period of the next couple of days, every time we would come home a little bit sauced we just ate a bit more sandwich. A good deli sandwich is a thing of beauty. What do you do when you can’t get to sleep? I do battle with insomnia from time to time. I’m one of those – I listen to creepy stories from Reddit being read in a monotone voice. I’ve been listening toPatric Gagne’s book Sociopath: A Memoir, and it is voiced by the author. She ends up getting a doctorate in psychology,specialising in sociopathy, and she’s the most self-aware sociopath I’ve ever heard of. She’s explaining,from the driver’s seat,what it’s like to be her,and what she can feel and what she can’t. It’s very interesting but also helps me go to sleep because the sociopath is out there and in my ears, but not in my house. What’s the oldest thing you own, and why do you still have it? I think with Chinese custom we tend to get rid of stuff, because new means auspicious. So I don’t tend to hold on to a lot; I’m pretty good when I move house. But if I really think about it, it’s probably a bracelet I inherited from my grandmother on my father’s side, which is two dragon heads interlocked. What’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity? It’s with Luke McGregor, who has become a friend of mine now! A couple of Logies ago, I was wearing a dress with gloves that extended into sleeves, so there was no gap to take your hand out. Gorgeous, gorgeous gown. He shook my hand, and he’s like: “How are you going to go to the loo in that dress?” And I didn’t really think about that when I tried it on. Luke is so lovingly awkward, and so am I, which is why we ended up bonding. We workshopped how I was going to go to the loo in this dress, and the answer was not to drink much water or anything at all so I didn’t have to go. In the end, I basically had to take the entire thing off to go and wash my hands, semi-naked, then get dressed again. What book or film do you always return to? I really love watchingRatatouille. It’s just wholesome and lovely and beautiful. And on the other side of the coin, the entire Fast and Furious franchise. Polar opposites, but they’re both really comforting. I just rewatched Tokyo Drift. Don’t ask me how many times I’ve seen it. It’s one of the worst and best movies of all time. I will routinely work my way through the entire Fast and Furious franchise because, you know, there’s nothing like family. What’s the weirdest thing you’ve done for love? Live on an abattoir in Tasmania for about a year. My boyfriend at the time owned and ran the abattoir and came from an engineering background; he ended up teaching himself how to be a slaughterman and a butcher. I’m still a very meaty kind of gal. I do feel like that entire experience made me so much more appreciative of the fullness of life, our access to meat. If you ever have the opportunity to see how it goes from animal to your dinner plate, you should do it. Because if you can’t face how your food gets to you, then maybe you shouldn’t eat it. I definitely don’t eat as much meat as I used to, because I want to make more conscious choices. I think if something has given its life for your nourishment, wasting it is highly disrespectful. Obviously, you need to be rational as well and flexible with how you live. But that’s the way I look at meat. What song do you want played at your funeral? Probably getting a little bit emo, but the Nine Inch Nails cover of Hurt gets me every single time. I’m not too ashamed to admit I want people to cry at my funeral. Otherwise, These Boots Were Made for Walkin’ by Nancy Sinatra. And if I could submit a third (this is, like, the pinball that goes on inside my brain on a daily basis):Killing in the Name. Who do you want to play you in the biopic about your life? Well, that’s a question about representation, isn’t it? Like, years ago, it’d be whoever the reigning Hollywood superstar at the time was – but who looks like us? I feel very fortunate in some small way on the small screen to be a part of the visibility of east Asian women in popular culture and in the media. Who would I have to play me? Michelle Yeoh is a badass. Did you see her at the Bottega Veneta show recently? My god. Her body of work from being an accomplished martial artist to an actor to comedy, drama … just the depth and range of her ability, the fact that she’s into combat sports as well, just gives zero fucks. The more she progresses in life, the more elegant and graceful and powerful she becomes. Just as a as a human being for reference in life, I could do worse than to emulate her in any capacity. I’m really glad that there are more actors to pick from these days for us as people of colour. Long may it continue.

The moment I knew: he hid his emotions – but after a week apart he said ‘I missed you’,,"Dean and I met in 1967 at the University of Adelaide when we were 18 years old and in the second year of our science degrees. We worked back to back in the biochemistry laboratory. I soon discovered to my delight that he was on top of the subject and could answer my questions. I remember thinking: “This man is smart, and useful.” Soon I would “accidentally” come across him at the cafeteria, library and bookshop. Eventually he asked me out but we only dated for a few months. There was no drama. We drifted apart. He told me later he found me too frivolous; I found him too serious. Fast forward two years and we were both studying for our honours. We began running into each other late at night in the library and we fell back into comfortable conversation. My mother noticed that he was being mentioned more often and invited him to my 21st birthday party. He looked so handsome at the door holding a big bunch of flowers, and got on so easily with my friends. As he climbed into his car to leave, he asked me out to the movies. A week later we were early to the movie session, so we window-shopped. We talked and talked; he had such wide interests. Every time he spoke I learned something. He was kind and quietly self-confident and I sensed a gentle strength about him. He wasn’t as serious as I thought. I could make him laugh – the ultimate compliment. I was filled with joy. I didn’t want the window-shopping to end. That night he took me to see Charly, with Cliff Robertson; later, it was2001: A Space Odyssey. Maybe it was a test since science fiction was one of his passions. If so, I passed. Being with Dean was so intellectually stimulating. He opened up new worlds for me. I began to work through his science fiction library. I’d have dinner with his family and then we’d both retire to his bedroom and shut the door – to listen to classical music. The family said later they wondered what we were doing. Beethoven! We shared an interest in astronomy and combined our meagre savings to buy a telescope. He understood the scientific and technical aspects; I knew my way around the sky and could show himSaturn’s rings. His main hobby was shell collecting, and his idea of the perfect date was us crawling on our stomachs along the beach, looking for tiny shells. It became my favourite activity. We became inseparable. Dean was reserved, independent and hid his emotions. I didn’t expect declarations of undying love. About three months into our relationship, he went away to a week-long science conference – I told him I’d miss him. His reply: “I’m going to have a good time.” I met the bus when he returned, waiting excitedly at the stop late at night. As he came down the bus steps, I realised he looked a little pale and seedy. We hugged. Then as we turned to leave he said, “I missed you”, not looking at me, not in a romantic way but almost defiant. How dare I get under his skin! How dare I force him to express an emotion! I took a moment to process what he’d said and then the words hit me like a thunderbolt. That’s when I knew he loved me. And he’d broken through a hangover to express it. He was never going to get rid of me after that. We went back to our respective homes and I think he must have slept well but I was possessed by a happy restlessness. We married in 1971 (I asked him) and have been together for 53 years. What I didn’t perhaps appreciate at first was Dean’s kindness, patience, respect for others and loyalty. His calmness balanced my more outgoing personality. He did half the housework and eventually took over the cooking. He was a hands-on parent to our daughter from the start, changing nappies and comforting a restless baby all night. This was not so common for men in the 1970s! He nursed me through two bouts of breast cancer. Older people called on him to help with odd jobs and computer wrangling. Of course we sometimes clashed. I was neat and he was messy. He was cautious, I was more impulsive. We were both stubborn but we learned to say “sorry” and mean it. Most of all, we had such fun. Love is knowing there’s always someone who’s on your side. It’s been a life of adventure, travel, learning and sharing. We loved the outdoors. We studied and wrote about nature, and spread the conservation message. We’ve experienced ancient fossil sites, active volcanoes and the Arctic tundra; camped alone in a vast red desert, hiked the Rocky Mountains, and journeyed to places in Kyoto mentioned in ancient Japanese literature. After retiring from our science careers, I worked on the moth collection in Museums Victoria. Dean was down the corridor working on shells. I’m now the only one who carries these memories. Dean has severe dementia and is in a home. When I visit he recognises me occasionally. Then he smiles and takes my hand. We walk in the garden of the home and, as always, our love for the outdoors brings us together. Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

Australia make Scotland pay price for indiscipline to snatch WXV 2 title,,"Scotland’s defence of their WXV 2 title ended in heartbreak after a 31-22 defeat to Australia in a winner-takes-all showdown in Cape Town. Both sides went into their final match at the Athlone Stadium with two wins under their belt, but Scotland ended the game with 13 players and Australia came out on top. Australia raced into a 21-0 lead in the first 23 minutes with tries from Desiree Miller, Maya Stewart and Cecilia Smith, all converted by fly-half Faitala Moleka. Scotland hit back after Australia centre Siokapesi Palu was given a yellow card for a high tackle and tries from prop Leah Bartlett and full-back Chloe Rollie, the former’s converted by Helen Nelson, reduced the deficit to 21-12 at the break. The gap was cut to 21-17 early in the second period when Scotland prop Anne Young burrowed over for an unconverted try. Scotland’s momentum was then checked by centre Emma Orr’s yellow card for a high tackle, later upgraded to a red, before wing Francesca McGhee’s try put them 22-21 ahead with 10 minutes left. But after McGhee was shown a yellow card for a deliberate knock-on, Australia regained the lead through Moleka’s 74th-minute penalty and the Wallaroos sealed victory with Ashley Marsters’ late converted try. The result meant Australia topped the table from Scotland with both teams securing qualification for the Rugby World Cup in England next year. The draw will be made on Thursday with Australia coach Jo Yapp explaining just how proud she was of how her side had delivered three victories in successive weeks in Cape Town over Wales, hosts South Africa and WXV2 holders Scotland. “We had a challenging start, had very little time together to prepare early on and that time is now starting to show what we can do on the field,” Yapp said. “The way they played and conducted themselves, they really are inspiring and for me, seeing them over the last couple of weeks in South Africa going into schools and engaging with young people, that’s what it’s all about and as people I’m really proud to coach them.” Sign up toThe Breakdown The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed after newsletter promotion South Africa saw their slim title hopes ended by a 23-19 defeat to Italy, Beatrice Rigoni kicking two late penalties to take the game away from the hosts.

International arrest warrant issued for former Wallabies star Rocky Elsom,,"An international arrest warrant has been issued against the former Australia rugby captain Rocky Elsom who was sentenced in his absence to five years in prison by a French court for misuse of corporate assets, a lawyer in the case told AFP. Charges were brought after Elsom’s spell as president of French club Narbonne between 2015 and 2016. Elsom, who played 75 times for the Wallabies, was also found guilty of forgery and ordered to pay back €705,000 (A$1.1m), the lawyer Patrick Tabet told AFP. Elsom, who was president of the club in 2015-16, was also accused of having paid €79,000 to a former coach when “nothing could justify it” and of hiring for about €7,200 a month an individual living in Australia who “never came to Narbonne” and “did not perform any service” for the club, the lawyer said. The president of the court handed down a sentence higher than the prosecutor’s request of two years in prison.

Rugby Australia hits back at Melbourne Rebels in $30m legal fight,,"Rugby Australia has escalated the growing legal dispute with directors of former Super Rugby team Melbourne Rebels, alleging misleading and deceptive conduct by the club and preparing a counter-claim after a$30m lawsuit was lodged by the directorson Wednesday. The Rebels were placed into voluntary administrationin January, and Rugby Australia took control of the club. Thegoverning body decided against reinstating Melbourne’s Super Rugby licencein May, triggering a legal to-and-fro which has exploded this week. A statement issued by RA on Thursday said the organisation was “disappointed” by the “inaccurate and misleading comments in the media” and rejected the “ambit claims and attempts to shift blame for their financial mismanagement”. “RA is preparing a counter-claim against [Melbourne Rebels] and its directors for misleading and deceptive conduct concerning the financial position of [the club] dating back to 2018,” the statement said. The Rebels directors had argued in a statement of claim lodged on Wednesday in the Federal Court that RA had knowledge of the club’s financial position for several years, and had not acted in accordance with the legal agreements between the parties. RA’s response issued on Thursday said it had relied on the alleged misleading and deceptive conduct in allowing the club to be part of Super Rugby. “Had RA not been misled or deceived, it would not have provided [the Rebels] with a participation licence and thus not lost in excess of $35 million that was paid to [the club] since at least 1 July 2018,” the statement said. RA also cited the administrator’s findings of financial problems going back to 2018, and the revenue challenges faced by the club. The directors issued a response on Thursday afternoon to RA’s statement, alleging the governing body has made “completely false and self-serving counter-claims about the Rebels”.

Melbourne Rebels launch $30m lawsuit against Rugby Australia,,"Rugby Australia faces a new legal and financial headache after directors of the now-competition-less Melbourne Rebels commenced proceedings in the Federal Court over theclub’s exclusion from Super Rugby Pacific. The allegations in the statement of claim include breaching of funding obligations, liability of RA for payment of Wallabies players, and misleading conduct. The plaintiffs will be seeking more than $30m. A joint statement issued by club directors said “significant damages and indemnities” are being sought, and they wish for the Rebels to continue to play in Super Rugby. “The Rebels are seeking an urgent order granting the Rebels the right to inspect the RA books, including accounting and loan records, to determine whether (and the extent to which) there has been fiduciary and governance failures by RA,” the joint statement said. The governing body said it would comment when it has reviewed the 54-page statement of claim, which was lodged with the Federal Court on Wednesday. The Rebels’ viability has entered the public spotlight in the past year after their chairman Paul Docherty – whose company was the team’s major sponsor – fell into financial strife. RA took control of the club in Januarywhen it entered voluntary administration and in Maydecided not to reinstate the franchise for 2025. The directors’ statement said they “will be providing the court extensive documentation demonstrating that RA was aware of the financial situation of the Rebels at all times”.

Curse of Bears strikes again as expansion bid collapses over refusal to sweeten NRL honeypot,,"Many claim the North Sydney Bears are cursed. Australian Rugby League Commission chair Peter V’landys now has good reason to believe them. AnNRLexpansion bid by North Sydney’s Perth-based “franken-club” the Western Bears to join the NRL ultimately failed to impress the rugby league tsar, who now faces a race against time to prove to broadcasters his code is worth as much – or more – than the AFL. It was an astonishing development in a process that until now seemed pre-ordained. A timeline towards 20 clubs within the next five-year broadcast cycle appeared straightforward, with as many as 11 parties reportedly interested from everywhere between Perth and Christchurch. But nobody, not even “Saint Peter” himself, wields more power than the clubs. The ARLC must convince three quarters of them of the merits of the expansion proposal. The Bears may have cut-through with nostalgic New South Wales rugby league fans, but officials in clubland have no such attachment. Rather, they might generously be described as pragmatic. The Bears’ submission failed to include the offer to the NRL of a licence fee – a sugar hit which could help the NRL placate the clubs – prompting V’landys to declare the business case didn’t stack up. The bid instead combines Perth corporate and government support and the knowhow and infrastructure of the North Sydney club (which still plays in the second-division NSW Cup). The Western Bears bid is now “on life support” according to consortium member Peter Cumins, the Cash Converters executive deputy chairman, who refuses to write the NRL a blank cheque. “We’ve got to be very conscious of the fact that if there is a [licence] fee to be paid and it’s significant, we’ve got to make sure we can honour the commitment that we make.” The Bears can point to the example of the Dolphins, which were not required to pay a licence fee when they joined the NRL two years ago. Federal member for Bradfield in Sydney’s northern suburbs, Paul Fletcher, this week told the NRL in parliament to “get on with it” and don’t use “vaguely described financial considerations” to block the Bears’ return to the elite level. Western Australian premier Roger Cook is part of the push for the Western Bears. “We continue to discuss aspects of the bid process,” Cook said, confirming that he had exchanged text messages with V’landys since the decision. “Obviously, the bids went in. I think ours was the strongest. But we need to address some of the issues the board had concerning that bid,” he said. Rugby league in Australia is in a healthy state, with clubs seemingly free of financial turmoil and the NRL reporting a $58m operating surplus on revenue of more than $700m in 2023. Yet health in Australian sport is a relative thing. The AFL signed a $4.5 billion with Channel Seven and Foxtel in 2022 which kicks in next season. At around $640m per season, it far surpasses the NRL’s current arrangement which is estimated a little over $400m annually, even though the NRL outperforms AFL on a range of ratings metrics. Sign up toAustralia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter promotion Although the NRL’s current TV deal runs until 2027, V’landys and chief executive Andrew Abdo will soon ramp up discussions with broadcasters. In an increasingly challenging commercial TV landscape, the NRL’s most straightforward path for a broadcast bump is through increasing its volume of content. Adding one more team would allow nine NRL games each weekend, and if Perth was included it would open up another option for an evening match broadcast on the east coast. But more games might not be best for the product. The Rugby League Players Association has resisted any increase to the length of the season, and the effort to tack on internationals in spring is already forcing the game’s best players to play more than 30 matches each year. At theNRLWlaunch this season, Abdo said expansion would allow flexibility in scheduling and potentially even a reduction in rounds. The by-product of this week’s drama is the transformation of the Papua New Guinea bid. What was once risky is now the closest thing V’landys has to a sure thing. The proposal includes a $600m, ten-year commitment from the federal government, including – significantly – a $60m license fee that will beshared among the clubs. $29m each year will be budgeted for the football team, and another $25m per year will go towards programs jointly run by the NRL and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade designed to improve education and living standards in the region. The PNG government has committed to building the club’s accommodation and training base and providing income tax exemptions worth several million dollars per year to make living in Port Moresby more attractive to players. “There are a few more regulatory processes to complete before an official announcement can be made,” Prime Minister James Marape said this week, ahead of Sunday’s Prime Minister’s XIII exhibition matches. “As PNG approaches our 50th next year, it will be a good golden jubilee gift.” An announcement on NRL expansion is expected by the end of November.",Jack Snape,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jack-snape,2024-10-12,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/13/curse-of-bears-strikes-again-as-expansion-bid-collapses-over-refusal-to-sweeten-nrl-honeypot
Wigan secure back-to-back titles after Bevan French’s stunner sinks Hull KR,,"History comes in all different shapes and sizes. Heck, there were two different pieces of history on the line here in what felt like one of the most absorbing Grand Finals in history during the buildup. But every now and then, there is a moment in time that surpasses all others. As Wigan lifted theSuper Leaguetrophy aloft under the lights at Old Trafford, it was difficult not to think we were witnessing a moment that may not be seen again for some time. Consider that, before this, only four teams in the 129-year history of rugby league had swept the board and won the four major trophies on offer to them in that particular season: Hunslet in 1907-08, Huddersfield in 1914-15, Swinton in 1927-28 and Wigan in 1994-95. Matt Peet’s side added their name to that exclusive list to become the first team in the Super League era to win a grand slam. While there is an argument that teams from different eras should not be compared, this Wigan side must now be considered one of the greatest ever. In a salary-capped sport, for one club to win every domestic trophy on offer in a single season is nothing short of sensational. And there was an eerie warning to the rest from Peet after the match. “This isn’t the end,” he said. “We’ve got so much more learning to do and so much more to build connection-wise. I think it’s for others to make comparisons, there have been some very good teams.” Having alreadywon the World Club Challengein February, theChallenge Cup at Wembley in Juneand theLeague Leaders’ Shielda little over three weeks ago, you always felt it would take something special from Hull KR – themselves bidding for a slice of history – to prevent the inevitable. In testing conditions, this was an attritional game. But that is exactly what Wigan like; they have made it their business to win matches of this nature, where the margins can be fine and the stakes at their highest. The decisive play came midway through an absorbing first half, when you sensed the wind disappearing from Hull KR’s sails in one moment of brilliance. Rovers had dominated the opening quarter in terms of territory but had little to show for it. Then, with Wigan mounting their first meaningful attack, Bevan French stepped off his right foot to puncture the Hull KR line before doing the same again to bamboozle Niall Evalds and open the scoring in sensational fashion. On a night when French became the recipient of the inaugural Rob Burrow Award for player of the match, it was a fitting moment, given how Burrow scored an equally superb try here 13 years earlier. When Harry Smith kicked a drop goal on the stroke of half-time to make it 7-0 and open up a two-score lead, it felt like a significant margin. “He can do things other players can’t,” the beaten coach, Willie Peters, said of French. “Wigan are still the leaders in this competition and they showed it again tonight.” Sign up toThe Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion For the Robins, who earned so many admirers throughout 2024, this was a game too far. Bottom of Super League in 2020, they have emerged as a force this year but their wait for a first trophy since 1985 continues. “I’m extremely proud to be head coach of this team,” Peters said afterwards. “The players didn’t let anyone down tonight.” As he pointed out, the Smith drop goal was a big moment. Conditions deteriorated after half-time, making penetrating a resolute Wigan defence an impossible ask. This Wigan side are renowned for closing out contests when they are ahead. Unfortunately for Rovers and their 20,000-strong army of travelling supporters, they did not really have much of a spark to even suggest a comeback could be possible. A penalty from Mikey Lewis reduced Wigan’s lead to five points but four minutes later Adam Keighran responded to make the gap seven again. That left the remaining 15 minutes feeling more like a procession than a grandstand finale. From there, Wigan did what Wigan now so often do: see it out with minimal fuss to cement their place in history.",Aaron Bower,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/aaron-bower,,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/12/wigan-hull-kr-super-league-grand-final-rugby-league-match-report
Apocalypse now: City wrangle shows the wealthiest owners could kill football,,"Don’t look up! As the families of Westeros squabble, the undead gather beyond the Wall. As senior monks jockey to be the new abbot, viking longboats mass on the horizon. As the left bicker interminably over infinitesimal doctrinal differences, right-leaning billionaire tech-bros fund the march of quasi-fascistic populism. The problem with existential threats, from the climate crisis to Conquistadors to Covid, is that they always seem distant, somehow unreal. People are always predicting the end of the world, which makes it easy to dismiss the doom-mongers. When we’ve had so many warnings of the apocalypse, why should anybody listen now? But some day one of those prophets is going to be right. Nothing is eternal. Football has never been so popular. Crowds in England are at the highest they have been for half a century and, if you include non-league football, probably ever. The global television audience is vast. It is an all-consuming universal. And yet that is its very problem; football is so magnetic that it has drawn the interest of too many who see it not as a sport, not as cultural expression, but as an entity from which they may profit. Other sports, while never having quite football’s global appeal, have been unassailably popular in the past, only to decline: no one goes to the arena to watch gladiatorial combat any more, chariot-racing is defunct, cockfighting has had its day, even cricket – once England’s national sport – feels locked in a perpetual battle to survive, the rash of cash-boosting short-form tournaments reducing the schedule to unfathomable irrelevance. Football’s structure is different, but as new competitions are invented and existing ones expanded, its calendar does increasingly feel packed with content for content’s sake. Football has proved extraordinarily resilient for 150 years but the existential threat is there. As fans and pundits and media have quarrelled over the past week about just who “won” thePremier League v Manchester City legal battleover associated party transactions (APT), taking up their pre-assigned positions behind the barricades, it’s all a bit Fuji and Kodak fighting a sales war 20 years ago: er, have you heard of digital? The sport is now in the hands of states, oligarchs and private equity funds, none of whom, it’s fair to say, are likely to care much for the long-term good of the game. They are all rich enough to pursue hugely expensive litigation that could cripple football’s administrators, a point made explicitly in the email published byDer Spiegelpurportedly from City’s general counsel, Simon Cliff, that quoted the club’s chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, threatening “the destruction of [Uefa’s] rules and organisation” by suing them “for the next 10 years”. For a long time it’s been problematic that those who govern the game also run and derive profit from competitions, creating a nexus of interrelated incentives that has led to clientelism – but this is worse. What future does any organisation have if a member has the power effectively to decide thatit doesn’t have to obey regulationsvoted for by the others, the “tyranny of the majority”, to use another phrase used by City? What the case seems to have established is that financial regulation is necessary to prevent successful clubs becoming a self-perpetuating elite, and that loans from shareholders to their clubs should incur interest at market rates so as not to count as a subsidy for the purposes of profita­bility and sustainability calculations. All of that seems entirely reasonable – and was already part of Uefa financial fair play regulations. City, it could be argued, have done the game a favour by closing a loophole that ensures tighter financial controls. However, if that were their aim, it seems odd that they would describe the Premier League’s plan to update the regulations accordingly as “an unwise course”, which “would likely to lead to further legal proceedings with further legal costs”. The broader issue now is whether they have isolated a procedural flaw that could undermine the Premier League’s 130 charges against them (they, of course, deny them all). There are those, often cloaked in free-market dogma, who argue there should be no restrictions on what clubs can spend. But then the rich win, generate more revenue, buy the best players and win even more. Sign up toFootball Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion That’s why, until 1983, home teams in the English league paid the away team a levy and why a maximum wage was implemented in 1901. The maximum wage soon proved exploitative but the significant point was the rationale behind it: there has to be regulation to prevent the richest clubs developing what would in effect become monopoly positions – a principle that would be accepted by all but the most libertarian free-marketeers. No one ever seems to consider how the game should look. In an ideal world, how many points would the average Premier League champions get? What is a club? What happens when the investment funds of authoritarian states with command economies start dabbling in a free market? The issues are complex, global and would require an enormous, perhaps impossible, amount of consultation and collaboration to resolve – but these are questions that are not even asked. Everyone is wrapped up in their own self-interest, driven by their own greed. And that brings danger. Already at certain clubs there is a clear preference for high-spending occasional fans over regulars. Tournaments are bloating. The Champions League is a footstep from being a Super League. There is more and more content and less and less of it means anything. Financial bullies, celebrated by fans and partisan cheerleaders, seek the right to bully financially. Football is being dragged away from the communities that fostered it. What if the global appetite dwindles? What if this new audience moves on, to MMA or esports, or something else? If English football has ostracised its base, it might find there isn’t much left, and the self-absorbed mega-rich aren’t going to hang around to bail out the decades-old institutions they own; the medium-to-long term isn’t in their thinking. What if an infinitely rich owner bankrupts the Premier League? How might football end? Through the greed and monstrous self-interest of those who never really cared for that game, and the complacency of those who allowed it to happen.

Chelsea hold on for victory at Arsenal to cast more doubt on Eidevall’s future,,"Jonas Eidevall said he “fully understands” the disappointment of Arsenal fans after two goals in 12 minutes did the damage in a loss against Chelsea that gave the Gunners a mountain to climb in a crunch game at the Emirates. “I fully understand that people are disappointed when we don’t win football matches and we are also really disappointed,” he said, in response to some fans booing when the side conceded their second. “We are really hurting; I’m hurting, the players are hurting. We want to do that better, so I fully understand that in that moment, just as you’re allowed to show emotions when we win, you’re allowed to show emotions when you lose. They invest everything, they travel, they support us, they give us absolutely everything. I totally understand their frustration when we don’t win football matches.” If the mood among fans is anything to go by, it feels as if Eidevall’s future at Arsenal is hanging by a thread. Four games into the season, Arsenal have one win and already sit four points behind the champions, Chelsea, who have a game in hand. Meanwhile, they suffered a bruising5-2 defeat by Bayern Munichin the Champions League after leading in midweek, off the back of a poor 0-0 draw with Everton. The loss of Vivianne Miedema to rivals Manchester City also hangs a dark cloud over the club. For a team wanting to challenge for titles, this is all being viewed as just not good enough, a mock P45 at the match circulatingamong fans on social media. Eidevall urged supporters to take heart from the players’ fighting spirit. “They should see the players and how incredibly hard they work. How much heart they have, how much character they have for the club. That, I hope, gives supporters belief,” he said. Arsenal can be buoyed somewhat by their second-half performance, the players roared on by the anxious majority of the 45,860 fans present. But the damage had already been done, a lacklustre and chaotic start acting as a microcosm of their season so far. Eidevall has repeated the line “pressure is not just a privilege, it’s a necessity” throughout the start of the new campaign but this kind of pressure is neither. Arsenal are on the back foot and then some, every game a cup final now as they limp forwards, buying time. An unemployed Casey Stoney was sat in the stands with her family, a reminder of the quality on offer should the club’s hierarchy decide Eidevall’s time is up. The Swede had spent a good portion of his pre-match interview with the BBC talking about the work they had been doing on defending set pieces, aware of the threat posed by Chelsea in this area. It was somewhat brutally ironic then that the visitors took the lead within four minutes via a corner, Mayra Ramírez, with her back to goal, scooping the ball over her head; it looped down and softly in. Sign up toMoving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football after newsletter promotion Ramírez, swept away in celebration, stopped to face the Arsenal fans, arms crossed, head nodding while Sjoeke Nüsken slid between her legs to pose on her stomach with her face in her hands. It was a celebration full of the swagger that mirrored Chelsea’s first-half performance. Their second goal was similarly impressive, Lauren James swinging away from the byline to send a cross to the back post where an unmarked Sandy Baltimore headed in. The home team pulled one back before the break, Caitlin Foord mirroring a move she had made earlier in the half when having an effort deflected over. She wriggled past Lucy Bronze at the byline before curving the ball past Hannah Hampton and into the far corner from the tightest of angles. Arsenal looked a much more coherent side in the second half, but the bar had been set low. The arrivals of Frida Maanum then Stina Blackstenius had an immediate impact, and Blackstenius hit the bar with five minutes of normal time remaining. This was Chelsea’s game to lose though, the Blues happy to bank back against a team that has struggled to break down low blocks and would accrue only three shots on target among 20. What next for Eidevall and Arsenal? They host the Norwegian side Vålerenga back at the Emirates on Wednesday.

Great Britain make stuttering start to historic bid for America’s Cup glory,,"You can buy a lot of things with £100m, but it turns out that a good start to the America’s Cup isn’t one of them. After 10 years of work, Ineos Britannia had the worst possible opening to their challenge against Emirates New Zealand, and went two-nil down in the best-of-13 series after the first day of racing. Their skipper, Ben Ainslie, and his team need to find a way to catch up – and fast – before the series runs away from them. “It’s not the start we were looking for,” Ainslie ­admitted, in a rueful expression of the ­glaringly obvious. “We just couldn’t quite match them around the track.” If one thing was clear after the opening day, it was that they will gain nothing by waiting for New Zealand to gift it to them through making any mistakes of their own. Their ­performance, led by the skipper, Peter Burling, was almost faultless. Burling and his co-helm, Nathan Outteridge, controlled both races and outmanoeuvred Ainslie and his own co-helm, Dylan Fletcher, in both the pre-starts. The British boat spent most of the day chopping along in their wash. It did not help that Ineos Britannia were thrown off by a last-­minute problem with a battery before the opening race, which meant they were late into the start box. That error allowed Burling to seize control of the race before it had even begun, and his boat led through all six legs to win by a comfortable margin of 54 ­seconds. In the moments after the ­finish, Ainslie, who knows better than most, reminded everyone that there is “a long way to go yet, so don’t worry, we’ll keep pushing”. He was as good as his word with the second of the day’s two races being a lot closer. The two boats were neck and neck through the first two legs, when the lead swapped back and forth five times. But New Zealand did a better job of using the favourable conditions on one side of the course, and pulled away to win by 27 seconds. “I’ve always said it would be tough,” Ainslie said. “But that’s the game we’re in, and we’re going to keep plugging away.” He admitted that his boat “didn’t have the perfect entry” in the first race, but said his crew “didn’t do a whole lot wrong” from that point on. “The Kiwis just had a slightly ­better race.” Ainslie said he felt that the New Zealand boat, named Taihoro, had taken a “jump forward” in the weeks since it was last on the water. It hadn’t been seen in racing trim since early September. The New Zealanders have been able to spend that time ­tinkering with her configuration, while Ineos Britannia, and the four other ­challengers, were ­competing against each other for the right to race in the final. That also meant New Zealand had every ­opportunity to study Ainslie’s racing strategy, and the strengths and weaknesses of the boat. Ainslie’s team, on the other hand, were working off their best guesses about what shape the defender were in. Burling mischievously decided to make sure Ineos Britannia’s crew and coaches got the good look they had been longing for by buzzing their chase boats while he was circling the course before the start. It became clear enough that his team had made a couple of changes that turned out to be especially telling in the light wind. In the second race they were using a smaller jib and a skinnier rudder, which gave them a definite ­advantage when they were sailing upwind. Sign up toThe Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion Great Britain’s hopes now rest on their team of analysts, based 1,000 miles away in the Mercedes F1 ­factory in Brackley, working out how they can improve the boat’s performance overnight. Ainslie will also be hoping that the weather turns so they can see how the boats fare in heavy conditions but the forecast is for another day of light wind. There was so little of it around on the opening day that everyone had to endure a painful half-hour delay waiting for it to pick up to the six-and-a-half knot minimum limit so racing could get under way. Even that couldn’t dampen the buzz of excitement around the port. Saturday was a national holiday in Spain and the water was lined with thousands of spectators, ­jockeying with each other for a glimpse through the thickets of masts at the great ­racing boats beyond. There were a lot of British fans among them. They have been waiting a long time for this chance: the last time the British were in contention to win the America’s Cup was way back in 1964, but unless Ainslie and his team can find the edge they need, they are all going to be waiting a while longer to actually see them win it.",Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andybull,2024-10-12,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/12/x
The Ineos Effect: hit and miss as Jim Ratcliffe’s tentacles have gone global,,"Should Sir Ben Ainslie’s crew achieve the seemingly impossible and bring home the America’s Cup it will be the biggest sporting triumph yet for Ineos, whose tentacles now lie across the elite landscape in six disciplines. Despite heavy investment and the oversight of Sir Dave Brailsford it has been a mixed bag so far for Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s petrochemicals company; they have struggled to make their mark in Formula One and cycling, while it may take a superhuman effort to restoreManchester Unitedto greatness. They have encountered accusations of using sport to airbrush environmental concerns around their business. Ending Britain’s 136-year wait for sailing’s most vaunted prize would, in the short term at least, guarantee favourable headlines. What did they inherit?Ineos joined forces with Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup team in 2018, taking ownership of an outfit that were founded six years previously with the aim of providing a first British winner. How have they tried to make their mark?A key feature of Ineos’s sailing work has been cross-pollination withFormula One. It is no secret that Ineos Britannia work closely with Mercedes, modern yachts being likened in some quarters to F1 cars on water. Brains from Mercedes have been deployed to work on design and engineering; the instances of overlap are numerous and it is the most potent example of Ineos’ vision to share expertise and methodology between their different sports. What has their outlay been?£110m was put towards Ainslie’s bid to win the trophy in 2021; a similar sum is likely to have been put into this year’s high-profile attempt. How much success have they enjoyed?The 2021 bid fell short, with a defeat to Italy in the match-up to decide who would challenge the mighty New Zealand. But this time around they have been in outstanding form, outdoing Switzerland and then the Italians. That is an achievement in itself but success will ultimately be measured by the multiple Olympic gold medallist Ainslie’s ability to bring home the America’s Cup. Pulling it off would be Ineos’s greatest sporting feat to date. What did they inherit?Three challenges of increasing gravity. Ineos dipped their toe into football’s shark-infested water by buying the middling Swiss club Lausanne in 2017; two years later they purchased the Ligue 1 club OGC Nice, another historically mid-ranking side but with obvious potential. Earlier this year they completed the most eye-catching deal of all: a 27.7% stake in Manchester United, the biggest club in England and a creaking oil tanker that will take some turning around. How have they tried to make their mark?Ineos learned costly lessons at Lausanne, courting fury early on by redesigning the club badge to incorporate an element of their own logo. Investment in infrastructure and a stream of signings indicated their ambition, although a flow of loanees from Nice has pointed to their place in the food chain. High-profile signings such as Ross Barkley and Aaron Ramsey have been among those signposting their intentions on the Côte d’Azur. At United, the arrivals of a top-class sporting director in Dan Ashworth and a new chief executive in Omar Berrada, formerly of Manchester City, are intended to solve the off-pitch mess they discovered. What has their outlay been?Significant. While the sum paid for Lausanne is unknown, they are thought to have invested around £45m – a large amount in Switzerland – since gaining control. The takeover of Nice cost £88m and they have overseen a net spend of close to £100m on transfers. All this is blown away by the £1.25bn investment in United. How much success have they enjoyed?Any grand ambitions for Lausanne have yet to be realised: the club have yo-yo’d and sit mid-table in the top flight. Nice are yet to sustain a credible challenge in Ligue 1, oscillating between ninth and fifth since 2020, but are playing Europa League football this year. At United, the joy of a quick FA Cup final win over City papered over cracks that have widened in a poor start to this season. Prevarication over the future of their manager, Erik ten Hag, has not helped Ineos’ chances of creating a launchpad. What did they inherit?Mercedes were at the peak of their powers in December 2020 when Ineos became a one-third shareholder in the team. The pair had already signed a five-year principal partnership earlier that year. Lewis Hamilton had won six of the previous seven drivers’ championships and they had won every constructors’ championship since coming second in 2013. How have they tried to make their mark?Ineos are not particularly hands-on at Mercedes and Ratcliffe himself is rarely seen at grands prix, although their name is on the car. The expectation was that a team sitting atop the pile would continue their supremacy. What has their outlay been?The five-year partnership is understood to be worth £100m, divided annually. The outlay for their stake is anyone’s guess but could be north of £200m. How much success have they enjoyed?Financially, Ratcliffe and Ineos will have few complaints. Last year they took a share of a £75m dividend from the team, largely through healthy sponsorship revenues. On the track it has been downhill since Hamilton’scontroversial loss to Max Verstappenin 2021. Mercedes won the constructors’ championship that year but the well has been dry since: they failed to react smartly to a regulation change in 2022, while Red Bull and recently McLaren have outshone them on race days. Hamilton will depart for Ferrari next year. In a fast-changing sport, though, the murmurings are they will be well placed to revive when the rules next alter in 2026. What did they inherit?Ineos inherited a dominant, formidable, sometimes controversial winning machine when they took over Team Sky in May 2019. It was the sport’s biggest success story, masterminded by the peerless team principal Brailsford: a lavishly funded operation that won grand tours for fun and became cycling’s version of theGalacticos, turning the likes of Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome into superstars. The new-look Ineos Grenadiers had an imposing act to follow. How have they tried to make their mark?Team Sky were brilliant but often unloved. Ineos sought to soften the hard edges, foster a less corporate and controlling image, and cut more of a relaxed appearance. They have sought to freshen up with young talent but are yet to nurture anyone who can replicate the presence and aura of those Sky greats. What has their outlay been?Ineos are thought to spend around €50m a year on the Grenadiers. They are still firmly among the best-resourced teams although the likes of UAE Team Emirates and Jumbo-Visma have ensured that, unlike during the Sky years, they no longer blow their rivals out of the water. How much success have they enjoyed?Ineos Grenadiers have been left behind. A team that once led the way is a shadow of its former self and, beyond the evergreen Geraint Thomas, lacks a rider with the stardust to challenge for major podiums. There is an argument the decline can be traced to Brailsford’s move upstairs, in December 2021, to become Ineos’s director of sport across all disciplines. They have not won a grand tour since he became less hands-on and it raised eyebrows in July when Thomas described their leadership structure as “like a coalition government”. There is a feeling of drift, the aerodynamics expert Dan Bigham also criticising a lack of clear vision upon leaving in August. Young riders have generally failed to kick on and other teams are now bigger draws; meanwhile double Olympic gold medallist Tom Pidcock has recently been linked with a move away. Ineos must find clarity if they are to scale the heights of old. What did they inherit?The most famous, awe-inspiring rugby union brand in the world. Or at least serious involvement in it after announcing a six-year performance partnership in the summer of 2021, beginning the following year. The All Blacks and Black Ferns headlined the seven New Zealand national teams slated to benefit from Ineos’s global network’s six-year performance partnership. How have they tried to make their mark?Promised partnerships with their other sporting arms, broadly aimed at using technology and human performance to make gains on the pitch. More visibly, their logo has appeared on the teams’ playing shorts and training jerseys. What has their outlay been?The deal is worth around £4.3m a year, running until 2028. How much success have they enjoyed?Rugby is in little position to turn down the level of financial assistance Ineos waved New Zealand’s way but their involvement has met some scepticism. Greenpeace accused them of “greenwashing” their reputation and almost 29,000 people signed a petition against the deal. The Black Ferns will expect to retain their world title next year so the 2027 men’s World Cup may provide the best measure of any sporting gains added by Ineos. A return to the glory years would be a resounding success for an All Blacks team that finished runners-up last year and looks hard pressed to break South Africa’s stranglehold. What did they inherit?Early in 2022 Ineos confirmed a long-term partnership with NN Running Team. The star draw was Eliud Kipchoge, the greatest marathon runner of all time, who had consecutive Olympic golds and an ongoing world record to his name when the deal was struck. It was not unfamiliar territory: they had partnered with the team and Kipchoge two and a half years previously became the first person to run a full marathon in under two hours. How have they tried to make their mark?The initial aim was to ensure Kipchoge completed a hat-trick of Olympic titles at Paris 2024, reuniting the setup that had backed him in 2019. As part of the deal, NN have access to Ineos’ knowledge sharing network across sports they have invested in: those resources were drawn on as Kipchoge, along with a raft of other high-profile athletes on the team’s books, prepared for the Games. What has their outlay been?The figures are closely guarded. Ineos are listed as supporters of the team on the NN website while Ineos Grenadier, the 4x4 vehicle produced by Ineos Automotive, is cited as one of their suppliers. How much success have they enjoyed?Kipchoge endured what he called his “worst marathon” in Paris, failing to finish due to a back injury and subsequently calling time on his Olympic career. But there was joy for Joshua Cheptegui, another NN runner, in the 10,000m and the headline among several teammates’ medals at other major events was Wilson Kiplangat’s marathon gold at the 2023 world championships. NN’s expanding stable stretches beyond the legendary Kipchoge.",Nick Ames,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nick-ames,,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/12/the-ineos-effect-hit-and-miss-as-jim-ratcliffes-tentacles-have-gone-global
Artur Beterbiev beats Dmitry Bivol on points to become undisputed champion,,"Artur Beterbiev beat Dmitry Bivol by a majority decision to become the first undisputed light heavyweight champion in the division for more than 20 years. The 39-year-old Beterbiev (21-0, 20 KOs) had won all 20 of his previous fights by knockout but was forced the distance by his fellow Russian rival in Riyadh in the early hours of Sunday morning in a fight that had several swings of momentum and was almost too close to call. In the end, two ringside judges scored it 115-113, 116-112 for Beterbiev, with a third judge scoring it as a 114-114 draw. (The Guardianhad it 114-114.) The headline clash at the Saudi capital’s Kingdom Arena, postponed from June after Montreal-based Beterbiev suffered a knee injury, put all four major world titles – WBO, WBA, IBF and WBC – in the hands of one man for the first time. The last undisputed light-heavyweight champion was theRussian-American Roy Jones Jrwho beat Reggie Johnson to unify the WBA, WBC and IBF belts in 1999. Bivol made himself a moving target in a high-quality fight between the big punching and aggressive Beterbiev and a more fluid rival who landed eye-catching early blows and had the better of the early rounds. There was little between the two at the half-way point, with Beterbiev possibly behind but every round a close call in a fight short of fireworks but with plenty for the purists. Beterbiev knew he had to close with a bang in the last two rounds and raised the tempo but Bivol hung in there and fired back some powerful combinations. “I just congratulate Artur and his team, he deserves it,” said Bivol, looking forward also to a possible rematch. “I did my job, I felt I could do better, I always feel I can do better, but that’s the opinion of the judges. He won.” Australia’s Jai Opetaia earlier retained his IBF cruiserweight world title when Jack Massey’s corner threw in the towel two minutes into the sixth round with the beaten Briton bleeding from a cut to the side of his nose. The convincing win took Opetaia’s record to 26-0. Unbeaten Australian Skye Nicolson won the first women’s world title fight held in Saudi Arabia when she defended her WBC featherweight belt against Britain’s Raven Chapman in a unanimous points decision.

‘Cleveland v the world’: Guardians oust Tigers to reach ALCS tie with Yankees,,"For the third time in less than a month, theCleveland Guardiansmade a semi-circle in the middle of their clubhouse and emptied champagne and beer bottles on each other as ‘Rocky Top blasted through the speakers. The choice of music is unique. So is this team. The Guardians are an October surprise. Lane Thomas hit a grand slam off Detroit ace Tarik Skubal and the Guardians, who have won with timely hitting and a shutdown bullpen all season, followed that script for a 7-3 victory over the Tigers in Game 5 of their AL Division Series on Saturday. Next up for Cleveland is theNew York Yankeesin an AL Championship Series between two teams that have crossed paths six previous times in the playoffs. They last met in 2022, with the Yankees taking their ALDS in five games. Game 1 is Monday in the Bronx. With their $109m payroll, the Guardians are an oddity among baseball’s final four – the little guys taking on the big-spending Yankees, Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers. It’s Cleveland against the world. “We’re playing a very, very good Yankees team,” said Guardians first-year manager Stephen Vogt. “We’ve seen them in the regular season. This is one of the most talented teams in the league. So we know we have our work cut out for us.” Thomas had five RBIs for the Guardians, who weren’t expected to contend this season. But they won the tough AL Central under Vogt, giving the franchise a chance to stop a World Series title drought stretching to 1948. “We’re a step closer. Any time you’re a step closer, the more you want to win,” All-Star third baseman José Ramírez said through an interpreter. “And we want to win it for the city.” The Guardians had to take down Skubal, the front-runner for the AL Cy Young Award, to keep it going. The left-hander had not given up a run in 28 consecutive innings – 17 in this postseason – before the Guardians tagged him in the fifth for five runs, tying the most he allowed in 2024. “They wanted to face him today,” Vogt said. “And if you don’t show up fully confident that you’re going to win, you don’t show up to the field. That’s been our approach all year, and we’re not going to stop now.” Cleveland pieced together its big inning off Skubal with the team’s familiar, scrappy style dubbed “Guards Ball,” getting three singles – one an infield roller – to load the bases before Skubal hit Ramírez on the left hand to force in a run. “That’s who we are,” Vogt said. “That’s who that group has been in that room all year. As soon as we get punched, we answer. That’s been our MO all year long - as soon as we give up a run, our guys come right back.” That brought up Thomas, who hit a three-run homer in Cleveland’s 7-0 win in Game 1. The center fielder, who struggled in his first month with the Guardians after coming over in a July trade with Washington, connected on Skubal’s first pitch, sending it just over the 19ft-high wall in left-center field. When the ball touched down, the Guardians’ dugout emptied and the screaming, red-clad Progressive Field crowd erupted in celebration. It was another monster moment for Thomas, a Tennessee native and the reason why the club added Rocky Top to its postgame playlist. “Definitely had some struggles those first two weeks, or maybe even the month,” Thomas said, reflecting on his rocky start with Cleveland. “I’m just thankful they kind of hung with me and let me get my feet under me and kept giving me at-bats. It felt good to kind of come through late in September and obviously in the playoffs.” The homer was a rare misstep in what has been a dominant season for Skubal. “It was one pitch,” Skubal said. “I would love to have it back. But what a swing. In the moment, you think about executing the pitch and I didn’t do it. This will sting a little bit and it should.” As has been the case all season, Vogt leaned on his MLB-best bullpen, which showed some wear and tear. After Thomas hit his homer, the Tigers threatened in the sixth, scoring a run on a single by Jake Rogers and loading the bases with two outs. But Hunter Gaddis struck out Kerry Carpenter, who won Game 2 with a three-run homer in the ninth. The Tigers, though, kept clawing and closed to 5-3 on Colt Keith’s one-out RBI double in the seventh. Eli Morgan came in for Cleveland and struck out both batters he faced. Thomas hit an RBI single in the seventh to put the Guardians up by three, and Vogt turned to All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase, the AL’s saves leader, in the eighth to put the Tigers away. Throwing one 100mph fastball after another, Clase got the final six outs. When he retired Keith on a routine grounder to first, the Guardians could finally exhale and plan for their first ALCS visit since 2016. “These moments are made for confidence,” Clase said through an interpreter. “I feel that I’m made for that.” Skubal lost for the first time since 2 August, and the Tigers, who missed a chance to eliminate the Guardians at Comerica Park on Thursday, had their unimaginable late-season push end in disappointment. “I have a heartbroken team for all the right reasons,” said Detroit manager AJ Hinch, who pushed all the right buttons down the stretch. “I mean we left everything we could on the field against a really good team and we didn’t want the season to end as abruptly as it did.” Out of contention in August, Detroit regrouped and rerouted its season. Energized by some kids they brought up from the minors, the Tigers took off and went 31-13 after 11 August to earn a postseason berth – one of three AL Central teams to make it. They swept Houston in the wild-card round before meeting Cleveland in the postseason for the first time after more than 2,300 games between the franchises. The Guardians took hold of first place in April and never let go. Cleveland became one of the season’s biggest surprises, winning 92 games under Vogt, a former journeyman catcher who had no previous managerial experience. Before the game, Vogt was confident his team wasn’t done. “It feels like we’re going to New York,” said Vogt. The Guardians are on their way.",,,2024-10-13,sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/12/guardians-tigers-alds-game-5-report
Tadej Pogacar continues mastery with long-range raid to win Il Lombardia,,"Tadej Pogacar obliterated the field to win his fourth Il Lombardia in a row and claimhis 25th victory of the 2024 season. The Slovenian star powered away from the peloton with just over 48km to go and finished 3min 16sec ahead of Remco Evenepoel in second. Giulio Ciccone earned himself a spot on the podium with a move inside the final 5km to catch and go away from the chasing pack, but this race was all about Pogacar. The 26-year-old, who won two of the year’s three grand tours and the world championship rainbow jersey, attacked on the last major climb to leave the rest of the peloton behind. Evenepoel and the other hopefuls would not see Pogacar until the finish line in Como, as the world champion powered away to win by the biggest margin at Il Lombardia since Eddy Merckx in 1971. “Every victory is special, and today also,” said Pogacar after crossing the finish line. “The team worked so hard all year for all the victories we achieved, and today is no different. It was a big day for us, long race, hard race, and it was all dependant on our team, but we did a super good job and I’m super happy to win with the team.” Pogacar was given the platform for victory by his UAE Team Emirates colleagues who delivered their leader to the Colma Di Sormano with the fleeting breakaway group reeled in. “We planned it like this,” explained Pogacar. “The race is so hard that in the end the last 40km is more or less man to man. I knew if I had a decent gap on the top I can come to the finish, but you never know. There was a moment after the descent where it was false down but really fast, then a little bit up and down, and there I tried to push to win some seconds and win the mental game on this chase. Then it was one by one to the finish anyway.” Pogacar took a look over his shoulder before celebrating on the finish line, but he need not have bothered. “I was just enjoying the crowds, and looking forward to off-season,” he said. Another rider looking forward to a break is Tom Pidcock, who was a surprise omission from Ineos Grenadiers’ squad for the race when it was announced on Friday. Amid rumours of a departure from the British team, Pidcock said he was “deselected” from the season’s final monument.

England making themselves at home in world of cricket wonderment,,"In the moments after the first Test ended on Friday, in the warm – verging on searing, given the conditions – glow of aremarkable victory over Pakistan, Ollie Pope was asked where it ranked among the games he has been involved in over the past couple of years. Considering the mind-spinning absurdity of the match that had just finished, and the amount of history made over the previous five days – shattering the nation’s67-year-old record for highest partnership, becoming the first team to concede 500 runs and win by an innings, posting England’s highest score since 1938 and the highest ever compiled in Pakistan, England’s greatest individual innings since 1990, plus Joe Root becoming their leading Test run-scorer of all time, not bad for a few days’ work – his response was surprising: “It would be right up there,” he said. “Definitely top three.” England have now played 30 Tests sinceBrendon McCullum’s appointmentas coach in May 2022. There is no better illustration of the team’s transformation than that when he turned up they were at a no ebb rather than simply a low one, and now are in a place where a week of ludicrous overachievement and general wonder is merely “right up there”. Curiously they have done this without significantly improving one basic statistic: England had lost 13 of their previous 30 Tests when the New Zealander took over, and they have lost nine of the 30 since, very much in the same ballpark. Meanwhile they have all but extinguished the least entertaining of outcomes, dropping their draws from 23% to 3% and shifting all of those results to the win column, going from 10 victories in one set of 30 games to 20 in the next. In the end the only reason there is any confusion about which is their greatest recent win is that there are so many to choose from. Pope was happy to help with the process of elimination. “I can think of Islamabad, Hyderabad and Trent Bridge,” he said. “Probably those are ones that we really look back on, and this is right up with the rest of them.” Nottingham in 2022 was a Test that exploded at the last, in front of a crowd already giddy after grabbing free tickets for the final day. This was a legend written in about 20 minutes: New Zealand’s Daryl Mitchell and Tom Blundell shared a stand of 236, Ollie Pope and Joe Root scored big hundreds, but the game is remembered because ofwhat happened in the final session. England needed 160 to win with six wickets in hand, a proposition that appeared to straddle the borderline of achievability. But Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes scored 59 off the next four overs, and from there it was a formality. The game was the high-watermark of early Bazball and probably also of Bairstow’s Test career – that this is up for debate is only because for a few months that summer he appeared to forget that he was actually human – but it was basically a sugar rush. There are no humdrum away wins in India – across the past decade they average two-fifths of a home defeat a year – and perhapsHyderabad in January 2024stands alone on this list simply because of the standard of opposition and unfamiliarity of conditions (the current Pakistan team, by contrast, is a complete basket case). History was made here too: India had never before surrendered a three-figure first-innings lead, and this time they flubbed 190. In the second innings Pope made those 190 back on his own (with six to spare) and then Tom Hartley, mercilessly slogged in the first innings but bravely backed by Stokes, took the most improbable of seven-fers. Islamabad – the game was actually played in nearby Rawalpindi, but we’ll let that pass – in 2022 was the most obvious comparison to the latest win: the same host nation and a similarly drab pitch, the kind that produces either greatness or tedium and most frequently the latter. Sign up toThe Spin Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action after newsletter promotion England worked this out quickly and went with option one. They won the toss, scored 921 across two innings at 6.73 an over and declared on day four giving their hosts four full sessions to chase 343. Those tactics and only those tactics could have won the game, whichEngland did in the final minutes of daylighton day five, a triumph of imaginative captaincy and team spirit. This week’s game feels like the one, if only for the sheer absurdity of the numbers involved, that will be discussed by future generations. Ultimately this team might be judged by long-term achievements rather than one-off wins, however epic, but there is no shame in mastering those. The fact is that the only world in which a match as unforgettable as this Test in Multan does not stand alone, obviously and reflexively, is a world full of sporting wonder, high merriment and the best kind of chaos.

My abuse in the Osho Rajneesh cult has haunted me for decades. Now I’m ready to speak out,,"In 1978, when I was nine years old, I unexpectedly moved to India with my free-spirited mother, who had recently become a disciple ofBhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later known as Osho). Like others of her generation, she was swept up in the allure of Rajneesh’s promises: enlightenment, freedom and belonging. Osho denounced traditional religion, offering a new path to self-liberation through cathartic meditations and therapy groups, communal living and free love. In the west, they called Osho the “sex guru”. Shortly after our arrival at Rajneesh’s ashram, I was initiated into the community and the guru gave me a new name: Ma Prem Sarito. I felt as if I now belonged, and being in the ashram was an exhilarating adventure, a portal to a world where normal boundaries dissolved. School became a distant memory. The lush gardens and nooks and crannies of the ashram were transformed into a playground where my friends and I roamed freely, liberated from structure and rules. My mother, like many other parents, embraced Rajneesh’s philosophy that children belonged not to their biological parents but to the collective. Before long, I moved into the ashram and rarely interacted with my mother. Though I was loved by many sannyasins (Rajneesh’s devotees) and some looked out for me, there was no formal structure to ensure my emotional or physical wellbeing. Over time, the facade of love and celebration began to crack, revealing darker undercurrents that quietly enveloped me. It began innocently enough – a guard teaching my friends and me how to french kiss. But soon I began to sense the inappropriate attention of certain men. One day, a man coaxed me and another girl into giving him a hand job. We were both only 10 years old. Though I tried to convince myself it was just a game, a reflection of the open sexuality around us, it felt grossly wrong. Deep down, I knew that unless I remained vigilant, situations like this would continue to occur. These darker undercurrents entangled me more fully when, in 1981, the commune moved to the US. I was among the first to arrive at the ranch the commune had bought in central Oregon. It was during those early days that I was lured into what I thought was a love affair with a much older man. I was only 12 years old; he was 29. However, what I believed to be love was no such thing. At the time I suffered silently as he repeatedly drew me in with affection and took me to bed only to ignore me for days as I watched him pursue adult women and, in time, my peers. At the same time, other men circled, and eventually I gave in, as sleeping around and being “liberated” was the norm that was modelled to me. As time passed, I felt increasingly worthless and angst ridden, and took my bad feelings to mean I was flawed. We were to be positive, not negative, so I didn’t speak of my pain and confusion. When the commune collapsed in 1985, we were all flung back into the world unprepared. I was 16, disoriented, broke and unsure of who I was. The trauma of my upbringing haunted me, but I couldn’t yet name it. As the years passed, I came to see it for what it was and came to see how Osho’s teachings tilled the soil for abuse – under the guise of spiritual freedom to boot. It sickened me. I distanced myself from the movement, from the teachings, and forged a life of my own. Then in 2018 Netflix releasedWild Wild Country, a docuseries about the community at the Rajneeshpuram complex. Watching it stirred my heartache and my fury. The series brought Rajneesh back into the public eye – but it only scratched the surface, focusing on the political and criminal scandals in Oregon. What about us children? I gathered my courage and shared about my abuse in a Rajneesh Facebook group. At that time I was too scared to name my perpetrators. I found some support on the group, but many of the responses were the same old things I’d heard before, such as: “The kids seemed so mature”, or, “It’s not like all the kids were abused – it’s just how you choose to see it.” I left that discussion feeling enraged and determined to break my silence outside the insular Rajneesh community. I reached out to several peers I knew had also experienced abuse, hoping they would join me in speaking out. They all initially declined, but three years later, in 2021, I received an unexpected call from one of them telling me she was finally ready. We began to share our stories, igniting a reckoning in which many other commune youth, and even adults, came forward and shared their own stories of abuse. Each new revelation was heart-wrenching. One of my peers from Rajneeshpuram said she had slept with 70 men, another said 150. This was before either of them had turned 16. Children from the Rajneesh communes in Europe also spoke up. This is how I came to know Maroesja Perizonius, director of the documentaryChildren of the Cult. In her post, Maroesja recounted her own abuse in the Rajneesh commune in Amsterdam. For her, it began at the age of 13. Maroesja and I connected and quickly realised we shared the same determination to expose the systemic abuse that had been suppressed for too long. We each embarked on our creative paths: I began writing my memoir, and she set out to make a film that unveils the pervasive abuse carried out in the name of love and light. Though it has taken me decades to find my voice, I stand here today proud to join Maroesja and others to ensure that our stories are finally heard.

Trump wants the FCC to take CBS’s license away. This is a dark omen,,"Donald Trump’s 10 Octoberattack on CBSfor editing its 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris – a normal television process – is pure distraction. It is designed to draw our attention away from the fact that he wasafraidto give the news magazine its traditional interview with both political candidates. Trump’s statement that the Federal Communications Commission should “take away” CBS’s broadcast licensebetrays his ignoranceof the fact that the FCC does not license networks andforeshadows a full-on assaulton free speech and freedom of the press if he becomes president. History is clear that dictators move early to takecontrolof the media in order to censor information unfavorable to their people. Our safety requires preventing that control, as Thomas Jefferson wrote two centuries ago: “Theonly security of all is in a free press. The force of public opinion cannot be resisted when permitted freely to be expressed.” Only Rumpelstiltskin would fail to grasp how much Trumpcannot toleratecriticism from the press or anyone. Attacking mainstream media is his way ofdesensitizing usto the important role of the press in a free society. If you want a preview of how first amendment rights will disappear if Trump is elected president, look to his home state of Florida where Governor Ron DeSantis, his Maga copycat, runs that government in a way Trump would like to bring to the whole nation. On 9 October, wesaw one of the governor’s lackeystry to carve away freedom of speech and the press, along with reproductive rights. John Wilson, the general counsel to the state’s department of health, threatened the state’s broadcast stations with prosecution unless they removed a campaign ad promotingamendment 4.It’s the ballot measure to add abortion rights to the state’s constitution. The amendment 4 ad featured Floridian Caroline Williamssayingthat she would be dead had the state’s six-week ban on abortion been in effect when her health required one in 2022. The irony of the Florida government trying to quash the ad is rich. Here we have a bare-knuckles attempt at censorship from the party thatpurports to opposethe “cancel culture”. That’s not the end of the irony. The health department’s letter alleged that the pro-amendment 4 ad violated the state’s “sanitation nuisance” statute. This ground for government censorship, based as it is on a statute designed to prohibitoverflowing septic tanksorunclean slaughterhouses, fails the laugh test, much less the constitution. Still, don’t miss what’s going on here: people’s rightsare not removed in one fell swoop but rather in steps. The first stage is eroding people’s expectations that freedoms are sacred and will be respected. By getting us thinking we can live with this or that little invasion of someone else’s rights, autocratsnormalize those intrusionsand then expand them to cover all of us. Diminishing the media’s and the public’s rights to criticize a leader ishow dictatorships get started. That’s why American law – at least in its current state – forbids what Wilson was threatening. Campaign ads are core political speech,entitled to the highest level of first amendment protection. That means that content-based restrictions on such speechmust promotea compelling government interest and be the least intrusive way to promote that interest. Specifically, even false statements in the context of abortion law campaigning – and Williams’ statements in the ad were not false –must survivesuch strict scrutiny. AFloridacrocodile’s tears would be more compelling than Wilson’s description of Florida’s interest in protecting women from the ad’s purported “danger” – that it suggests that they need to go to other states or find unlicensed abortionists if they do not have access to an abortion in Florida. That danger arises from the statute, not the ad. If the department of public health is so concerned about women’s safety, why not issue a regulationclarifyingthat doctors will not be prosecuted if, in their professional judgment, they believe that a woman has “pregnancy complications posing a serious risk of death or substantial and irreversible physical impairment”? Without that assurance, a doctor’s decision to perform an emergency abortion isso chilledthat, in effect, there is no exception to Florida’s six-week ban. Interviews with Florida doctors establish their understandable unwillingness torisk their libertygiven the prospect of a district attorney second-guessing their judgment. But whatever the ban’s impact on the practice of medicine, Wilson and DeSantis’s effort to stop groups from promoting their point of view puts all of us in jeopardy. George Washington captured that danger at the beginning of the republic. As heput it: “The freedom of Speech may be taken away – and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter.” Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, 250 years later, are sending us a clear message that our lives and our freedoms are on the ballot.

"No matter who Tory members choose, the party has a mountain to climb in 2029",,"“This is the darkest day in the history of the Tory party: they’ve all gone absolutely mad,” a senior Conservative said when Margaret Thatcher deposed Edward Heath. He was expressing the widely held view that the party had just made itself unelectable by lurching to the right. Thatcher went on to win three successive general elections. Almost 50 years later, we hear the same – that Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick are too extreme tolead the Tories to victory. And that by excluding both left of Conservative-centre candidates James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat from the final ballot, Tory MPs have guaranteed Labour’s re-election in 2029. Thatcher sensed what the Conservative establishment was missing: that the economic consensus was politically exhausted, and that the voters were willing to give her developing monetarism a chance. As much of Europe moves right, the zeitgeist may be changing here too. It could be that Robert Jenrick’s unyielding approach or Kemi Badenoch’s confrontational style strike a chord with voters. But there are reasons to question whether either will turn out to be the next Thatcher (who governed for more than a decade) or even the next David Cameron (who did so for five years). These have less to do with the approach of the Tory leadership candidates than the fracturing of British politics. First, consider this contest itself. Thatcher won 52% of Conservative MPs’ votes in the final ballot of the 1975 leadership contest. Cameron won 46% in the 2005 parliamentary equivalent. These results provided stable platforms for both. But last week,Badenoch gained only 35% and Jenrick 34%. Cleverly took the other third of Tory MPs’ support. These percentages were eerily reminiscent of the 2001 Conservative leadership election in which the eventual winner, Iain Duncan Smith, gained only 33% of his colleagues’ votes in the final ballot. His leadership didn’t end well. And, indeed, of the 2022 contest in which Liz Truss obtained only 32%. Furthermore, neither Duncan Smith nor Truss topped the parliamentary poll. Nonetheless, party members, who have the final say, plumped for both. An election in which Tory MPs vote one way and Tory activists another is inherently problematic. It’s possible that Jenrick may find himself in the same position when this election ends. But whichever candidate wins, two-thirds of their colleagues will have voted for their opponents – not a great start. Now turn to the issue of fragmentation more widely: Labour are under pressure from the Greens in some big cities and, potentially, from Reform in much of the north. At first hearing, that sounds like good news for theConservatives. But if Labour are challenged on three fronts, the Tories are fighting on four: against the Greens in some rural areas, against Reform for older, poorer voters and the Liberal Democrats for younger, suburban ones.

Nobel winner Geoffrey Hinton is the ‘godfather of AI’. Here’s an offer he shouldn’t refuse…,,"Way back in 2011 Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist with aspirations to be a public intellectual,published an essayentitled “Why Software Is Eating the World”, predicting that computer code would take over large swaths of the economy. Thirteen years on, software now seems to be chomping its way through academia as well. This, at any rate, is one possible conclusion to be drawn from the fact that the computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton shares the 2024Nobel prize in physicswith John Hopfield, and that the computer scientist Demis Hassabis shares half of theNobel prize in chemistrywith one of his DeepMind colleagues, John Jumper. The award to Hassabis and Jumper was, in a way, predictable, for they built a machine –AlphaFold2– that enables researchers to solve one of the toughest problems in biochemistry: predicting the structure of proteins, the building blocks of biological life. Their machine has been able to predict the structure of virtually all the 200m proteins that researchers have identified. So it’s a big deal – for chemistry. But Hinton is not a physicist. Indeed, he was onceintroduced at an academic conferenceas someone who had “failed at physics, dropped out of psychology and then joined a field with no standards at all: artificial intelligence”. And he spent a year after graduation working as a carpenter. Yet he’s the guy who found the method (“backpropagation”) that enables neural networks to learn, which was one of the two keys that unlocked machine learning and triggered the current manic rise of AI. (The other was the invention of thetransformer modelby Google researchers in 2017). Where’s the physics in all this, though? That comes from Hopfield, with whom Hinton shares the prize. “Hopfield networks and a further development of them called Boltzmann machines were based on physics,” Hinton explained to the man from theNew York Times. “Hopfield nets used an energy function, and the Boltzmann machine used ideas from statistical physics. So that stage in the development of neural networks did depend – a lot – on ideas from physics.” So that’s all right then. But the media often describe Hinton as “the godfather of AI”, which has a vaguely sinister ring to it. In person he’s the opposite: tall, amiable, courteous, cerebral and endowed with a wry and occasionally caustic wit. When asked by Cade Metz for his reaction when he got the news of the prize, he replied that he was “shocked and amazed and flabbergasted”, which I guess is what most people say. But in 2018 he shared the Turing award – computer science’s equivalent of the Nobel – with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning. So he was always in the top league. It’s just that there isn’t a Nobel prize in computer science. Given the way software is eating the world, maybe that should change. There’s an old joke that the key to becoming a Nobel laureate is to “live longer” than your rivals. Hinton, now 77, clearly took note. But actually the most admirable thing about him is the dogged persistence with which he continued to believe in the potential of neural networks as a key to artificial intelligence long after the idea had been discredited by the discipline. Given how academia works, especially in a fast-developing discipline like computer science, that required exceptional determination and self-confidence. Perhaps what kept him going in his darker moments was the thought that his great-great-grandfather was George Boole, the 19th-century mathematician who invented the logic that underpinsallof this digital stuff. One thinks also about the impact that the prize has on people. When news of Hinton’s prize came through I thought of Seamus Heaney, who was awarded the literature prize in 1995. He described the experience as “like being hit by amostlybenign avalanche”. Note that “mostly”: one of the consequences of a Nobel is that winners immediately become public property, of which everyone and their dog wants a slice. “All I do nowadays is ‘turn up’,” Heaney wrote resignedly to a friend in June 1996. “I’m a function of timetables, not an agent of my own being. And it’s going to be like this for weeks and months still… Whatever the Stockholm effect will be finally, its immediate result is a desire to quit the job and get started againin propria persona(in my own person).” So… Memo to Geoff: many congrats.

The Marles-Tarnawsky dispute shows parliamentary workplace is still far from perfect,,"There’s a lot of complicated details surrounding the allegations that the deputy prime minister’s chief of staff has levelled against her boss. Peeking into broken relationships is rarely nice, and that includes professional relationships in politics. As the truism goes, there are always two sides. Richard Marles’ chief of staff, Jo Tarnawsky, alleges that in a 45-minute phone call on 30 April after she raised a complaint about other staff behaviour, her employer told her to find another job. She further alleges that wasn’t fair. Tarnawsky says she raised claims that other colleagues had undermined and ostracised her. She alleges Marles initially said he’d heard “no negative talking” and then a day later told her he’d had concerns about her performance for a year and she should find another job. Her lawyer, the Marque Lawyers managing partner Michael Bradley, argues that amounts to adverse action – being punished, instead of protected, for raising a concern. Tarnawsky further alleges that since May she’s been barred from her office without 24 hours’ notice and has been asked – and has refused – to hand over the code to her office safe, which contains classified documents signed over specifically to her. And she says she hasn’t heard from Marles in five months. Through his spokesperson, Marles has said that “a number of the assertions and recollections are contested” and that he had her welfare in mind “at all times” – somethinghe later restated himself in parliament, along with praise for the employee he first hired when he was a parliamentary secretary 12 years ago. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email In answer to an opposition question in parliament on Thursday, Marles said that “in this moment, I feel deeply sad that events have got to where they have”. “This is obviously very difficult,” he said. “Let me say that, in the way in which I’ve tried to manage this, I have done so with Jo’s welfare in mind at every moment.” He did not respond to her allegation that he has not contacted her in five months. There’s a curious fact in all this that’s easy to overlook. Tarnawsky has not been sacked. Officially, she remains employed as the deputy prime minister’s chief of staff. According to her version of events, steps have been taken to ensure she can’t do the job. But she has not actually been terminated. This raises a question: why not? Tarnawsky says before she raised her complaint, relations between her and some staff had become strained. According to others familiar with how the office ran, her way of doing things did not always go down well with some colleagues. She was a well-regarded bureaucrat and diplomat who’d done a stint as Marles’ chief of staff in the Gillard government and returned after the 2022 election from the office of the governor general David Hurley. There was, it seems, a cultural clash in the office. Whatever has ensued in the office in recent months, it’s clear the relationship between the deputy PM and his chief has been irrevocably damaged. Both Tarnawsky and her boss acknowledge she can’t work for him any more. And yet, her employment status remains unresolved. Despite being shocked by the 30 April phone call, Tarnawsky says she offered immediately to try to find another job. She says she asked for time to do that and to “depart with dignity”. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion But that has proven more difficult than she expected. She alleges that the government’s response to her situation has only increased the pressure. There is an understanding in government that when trust is broken between a minister and a chief of staff, there’s no coming back from it. There’s also an expectation that, in those circumstances, the chief will just accept their fate and depart. Certainly, the government expected Tarnawsky to agree to go – and quietly – offering her temporary employment and counselling support to help. But while she says she was happy to find a job, she drew the line at signing anything described as a “mutual termination agreement”. She argues it is Marles who wants her to go and that it wasn’t “mutual”. Nevertheless, the heart of her legal complaint is simpler than that. She alleges she raised a complaint and was punished for it and she says that wasn’t fair. After some back and forth in which lawyers became involved, she accepted a specially created temporary job while she searched for something permanent outside politics. She has been doing that job for three months. It expired on 30 September. Still, Marles hasn’t terminated her, nor has any other solution been found to the limbo in which she appears to be stuck, other than the proposed “mutual” agreement. Perhaps the reluctance to terminate her job is out of kindness. Marles has said how much he admires her social conscience and how grateful he is for the work she has done in his employ. Perhaps someone in government thinks terminating her would be a bad look – for her or for them. Perhaps there’s some other reason. She says it’s the lack of resolution that has caused her the most pain. No doubt some will say, so what? It’s an individual employment dispute. Why does it matter? Well the now very public stalemate has shone a light on the role of the new Parliamentary Workplace Support Service and what, exactly, it is supposed to do. The PWSS emerged from that searing national public reckoning towards the end of the Morrison government with how women in particular, and staff in general, are treated in parliamentary workplaces. In relation to human resources issues, the PWSS’s establishing legislation says it is there to “advise and assist” both members of parliament and the staff they employ. In this case, Tarnawsky was given access to free counselling through the PWSS – until she was informed there was a limit and she had exceeded it and was being cut off, a determination ultimately reversed after she engaged a lawyer. But while it was providing her counselling services, the PWSS also engaged its own lawyers to deal with her, having received a referral about the employment situation from Marles. That seems quite a complicated load to manage. When the legislation was introduced to establish the PWSS, the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, described it as “an independent human resources entity for staff and parliamentarians”. She said it would provide professional development and training for staff, support and resources to “professionalise” office management practices, access to coaching and early intervention supports including “policy, process and guidance to manage suspension and termination decisions”, and training and guidance on the code of conduct and behavioural standards. She did not mention resolving disputes. Yet that is one of the functions contained in its legislation. What’s more, it is empowered to “advise and assist” both sides. It’s hard to see how the PWSS can resolve complaints independently if it is advising and assisting both parties. And yet, that’s what it’s doing in the case of Tarnawsky’s dispute with Marles. The public focus on this dispute might help clear up how that works. Because on the face of it, there’s an obvious question: how does an organisation work for both sides in an intractable dispute and resolve it without benefiting one side more?

Being dangerously thin is back in. Is the body-positivity era officially over?,,"Ladies, have you been waiting with bated breath for an association of plastic surgeons to tell you what your body should look like this season? Have you lost sleep wondering whether your waist is on trend or not? Are you worried that your hips, which don’t lie, might be a little too 2005? Well, you are in luck! The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) have put their beautiful Botoxed heads together and decreed that we are entering the “ballet body” era. In a recentlypublished annual reportthat analyzed procedures done in 2023, the world’s largest plastic surgery organization noted that demand for an ideal “ballet body” is driving interest in liposuction and breast enhancement. Since ballet is notorious foreating disorders, one imagines it might also drive an increase in women starving themselves. “There really has been almost a decade of ‘more curves are better’, and really glorifying those,” the ASPS president, Steven Williams,told the Washington Postin an interview last week. “And now it seems like we’re taking a bit of an abrupt turn to something a little bit more slim.” While it might be abrupt, the turn hasn’t come completely out of nowhere. For a few years now, there has been a steady drip-drip ofarticles in the style pressexclaiming that skinniness is back in fashion, that “thin is in”. The Kardashians, it will not surprise you to hear, seem to have played an oversized role in shifting body-related discourse. While Kim Kardashian has always denied getting a Brazilian butt lift (BBL), she has beencreditedwith driving massive uptake of the posterior-enhancing procedure over the past decade. Then, in 2022, she gushed about goingon an extreme dietin order to fit into Marilyn Monroe’s dress for the Met gala, which seemed to help encourage a new cultural obsession with thinness. I’m not blaming all the world’s woes on the Kardashians, to be clear. The fashion industry as a whole has started glamorizing thinness. Vogue Business released a newsize-inclusivity reporton Tuesdayand said: “We are facing a worrying return to using extremely thin models” with “a plateau in size inclusivity efforts across New York, London, Milan and Paris”. “There’s been a decrease in size across the board and that includes already straight-size models,” one fashion insidertold the Guardianthis week. “A lot of models that used to be plus-size are now mid-size.” Some of the shrinking models may have had a little medical help. The rise of the “ballet body” comes amid a boom in anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic (which was originally developed to treat diabetes). Numerous celebrities, including the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, havetalked openlyabout taking semaglutide (the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy) for weight loss. Some celebrities are even cashing in on the trend: Kourtney Kardashian Barker has launched a wellness brand that is sellingwhat has been describedas an Ozempic-style supplement. The obsession with Ozempic has now reached such a fever pitch that some politicians are including it in their campaign promises. Eduardo Paes, the current mayor of Rio de Janeiro, recently promised to make a generic version of the medication widely available if he wins re-election. Paes told the Brazilian newspaper Extra that he lost66 poundson Ozempic and wanted to introduce it to the public health system. “Rio will be a city where there will be no more fat people. Everyone will be taking Ozempic at family clinics,” Paes said according to a translation of theoriginal interview by Quartz. Drugs like Ozempic can obviously be incredibly valuable for people who need to lose weight for health reasons. But a cultural shift towards idolizing “ballet bodies” coupled with this new category of weight-loss drugs is a dangerous combination. Doctors are already seeing people who shouldn’t be using these medications (and who have often got hold of them via online pharmacies)presenting with serious symptomsbecause of inappropriate use. The writing has been on the wall for a while, but now it feels like the body-positivity era is officially over and we are back to a world where women are dying to be thin. According toWoolf’s great-niece, Virginia Nicholson, Mattel was interested in creating a doll based on the late writer but her estate was vehemently against it. The rejected dollapparently looked likea “Laura Ashley milk maid with a sweet hair bun holding an accessory copy of Mrs Dalloway”. One imagines the doll’s accessories also included a room of her own. According to Melania’s new memoir, she exchanges letters with King Charles “to this day”. What on earth do they talk about? How toavoid your taxes? Their favourite gold trinkets? To be honest,I really don’t care, do u? While Melania sits at her desk writing long letters to the king of the United Kingdom, her husband is continuing to tour the United States yelling about how stupid women are. During a recent rally, Trump touched onKamala Harris’s appearanceon Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy, a podcast that is extremely popular with young woman. “I think the other one asking the question[s] is dumber than Kamala. [Cooper is] a dummy,”Trump said. “I’ve watched her over the years. That is one dumb – that is one dumb woman. Sorry, I’m sorry, women, she’s a dummy.” So there you go, the man whorecently promisedthat he “WILL PROTECT WOMEN AT A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE”, wants you to know that successful women are actually really dumb. “More than500,000 womenhave lost access to vital services like pre-and postnatal care, family planning and treatment for infections; over 17,000 pregnant women are in severe stages of hunger,”according to a UN News report. The suffering is unimaginable and there is no end in sight. One in eight girls and women alive today experienced rape or sexual assault before the age of 18, according toshocking new Unicef estimates. A strong contender for the 2024 Nightmare Neighbor of the Year award goes to an anonymous woman in Washington who had been feeding wild raccoons in her yard for the last few decades. What’s so bad about that? Oh, those racoons just told some other raccoons about the free meals who told some others raccoons who also told a few friends. Now, 100 or so raccoons are prowling the neighbourhood, demanding snacks andgenuinely creating havoc.

‘Try them in different places’ – how and where to hang your pictures,,"Wherever you get your pictures, in your mind’s eye you want them to be as expertly hung as the Royal Academy of Arts’Summer Exhibition. But poorly spaced frames and wonky canvases can spoil the final effect. In the first instance, think about where a piece of art will look its best and the hanging system – picture rail or hooks – that suits your home. “Pictures look different depending on where you hang them,” says HenryMiller, an east London-based art dealer and gallery owner. “Try them in different places.” He says direct sunlight should be avoided if possible: “Some mediums can take more light than others. Oil paintings are more resilient, but watercolours, drawings and photographs are not.” You could consider using UV glass, he says, as this will “protect the works for years to come” – you can buy sheets to fit your frames on websites including Etsy. The next step is tackling the hanging system. “If you live in a period home, you may have a picture rail already and all you will need is the hooks and wires,” says Miller. “It will save you making endless holes in the walls. It also frees you up to try different pictures without messing up the wall.” Think about the look you are trying to create. Some collectors break up walls into small feature areas and treat each one separately. On Instagram trends include creating asalon wall, where a number of pictures of varying mediums and sizes are hung next to one another, or curating a picture ledge – a narrow shelf on which you can prop your pictures. Generally speaking, the size of the gap between pictures is less important than keeping it consistent. Many interiors sites suggest a 5cm gap works well but if the frames are larger, then up to 15cm provides some breathing space. Lay the art on the floor or even use a piece of paper to come up with a scale that fits your room. A strict grid look more formal, whereas a group hung within a square or rectangle appears more relaxed. One of the most common mistakes to make is hanging pictures too high or low, with most professionals taking the view that art should be hung at eye level. This usually means positioning the midpoint of the picture 145cm-152cm from the floor or 20cm above a piece of furniture. Another approach is to visually your wall and divide into four horizontally – ideally your work should be in the third section when counting up from the floor. Before you reach for the hammer gather the other tools you are going to need. These include a tape measure (some experts suggest “trusting your eye” but this could end in tears), pencil, hammer, a range of hooks and nails. Also try to enlist a friend or family member to help. If your picture isn’t too heavy you can use regular picture-hanging hooks but if it is on the larger side, opt for a big hook with multiple nails to secure it. If it is really heavy, you may need to use a drill, raw plug and screw to fix a sturdier hook in the wall. Once you have used your measuring tape, lightly mark the wall where the centre of the picture should be and ask your assistant to hold the picture in place so you can step back to double check. When you are happy, place another mark on the wall at the top edge of the frame. Next, measure the distance between the top of the frame down to the wire or D-ring (if it’s a wire hold it taut). Returning to the wall, measure down from the point that marks the top of the frame to find the exact spot where the hook should go. What could possibly go wrong?",Zoe Wood,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zoewood,,lifestyle,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/12/how-to-hang-your-pictures-art
Picture perfect: how to buy art at prices you can afford,,"That a Banksy painting is worth morepartly shreddedthan when it was whole can make the art world seem like another planet for “in the know” people with big bank balances. But don’t be put off, it has never been easier to start your own collection. Next week, 20,000 visitors will descend onthe Affordable Art Fair(AAF) in London’s Battersea Park and over the four days will browse and buy thousands of contemporary paintings, sculptures, photographs and prints. It’s one of a number of similar events around the UK; the autumn months are a busy time in the art calendar. At the fair, seasoned pros rub shoulders with first-time and “tomorrow’s” buyers, says Will Ramsay, founder of the event. Ramsay started the fair to “make it easier for people to buy art”. As the event celebrates its 25th year, he declares: “We have done that.” The average spend at the fair is about £800, with prices starting at about £50 for an edition with a ceiling at £7,500. (An edition is a reproduction of an original image. It is up to the artist how many pieces are in the series; they are usually numbered and sometimes signed, which can add to their value and collectability.) An art work such as an etching which is one of 25, will cost less than a unique painting. “For an edition, we’re probably talking £50 to £500,” says Ramsay. “For a unique piece, it might be £200 to £7,500.” Just like buying anything for your home, you need to do your homework. With art, it’s not just about setting a budget, you need to wrestle with “how do I know what is good?” And “am I paying the right price?” Some people find choosing pictures a daunting prospect but buying art should be pleasurable, saysHenry Miller, an east London-based art dealer and gallery owner. “People worry about buying the wrong thing or paying too much,” or whether it will “match the sofa”, but Miller says “try to put all of that out of your mind.” He adds: “If you can afford it and you love it, that should be enough.” If you are still at the stage of figuring out which style or medium you like best, experts suggest joining a non-profit art institution as a way to gain exposure to lots of work. In London, for example, a Royal Academy membership starts at £138 a year or £67 for 16- to 35-year-olds. Most places have several pricing tiers and, generally speaking, the more you pay the greater the access to artists, curators and gallerists. Another simple option is to usesocial mediato follow artists, contemporary commercial galleries and art fairs for alerts on upcoming events in the arts calendar and to join mailing lists. “Instagram is becoming an increasingly important forum for artists, galleries and collectors, with a growing number of buyers purchasing works found through the platform,” says Katherine Oliver, consultant and ex-curator at the Royal Academy. Browsing online galleries –Artsy is the biggest– lets you compare artists, styles and prices. Also keep an eye on graduates from the major art schools such as the Royal College ofArt, Slade School of Fine Art, and Central Saint Martins. “Go to graduate shows, meet artists and talk to them about their work,” says Oliver. “In two or three years they could be represented by a commercial gallery and their pieces may rocket in value.” Research art online, then look at what is showing locally, or get involved with the local art scene, says Lizzie Glendinning, co-founder and curator ofWoolwich Contemporary Print Fairwhich bills itself as “disrupting the elitist nature of art fairs, and pushing the boundaries of print”. Glendinning adds that it really depends on why you’re buying and what you are interested in: “I like dark and moody, so I need to see that in real life.” Fairs can provide inspiration, Glendinning says. Woolwich, which is a mix of specialist galleries and artists selected by industry experts, is expected to attract 15,000 visitors from 21-24 November. “No one is expecting anyone to drop £30,000,” she says, although some people do – one of the galleries made a £60,000 sale last year. At the moment alack of megasalesmeans that the top end of London’s art world is feeling a chill. People are still willing to spend five- and six-figure sums at the bigger fairs, but one analyst said that when the price topped £1m “they were just a little bit more cautious”. “At the high and middle end in a less booming economy the art market suffers,” says Ramsay. “However, at the Affordable Art Fair level, over the 25 years we’ve seen fairly little difference in the overall art sold. That is because we gain some people who might have bought more expensive work and sadly lose some off the bottom, for whom it is too tight.” If there’s a piece that you’ve fallen in love with but it’s too expensive, then don’t be afraid to ask if you can pay in instalments. If it’s a “no” then ask if the artist has smaller works or whether it is possible to commission a piece from them that better fits your budget. Another option is to look out for editions produced by major artists to help raise funds for non-profit making organisations such as the Royal Academy. Allied Editionsis a “unique artist editions collective” of seven London venues – including the Camden Arts Centre and the Whitechapel Gallery – with prices starting at £100. It has a stand at this weekend’s high-end art fair Frieze London selling limited editions from a roster of famous names includingMonster Chetwynd,Judy Chicago,Lubaina Himid,Chantal Joffe,Barbara Kruger,Helen MartenandYoko Ono. It is also possible to spread the cost thanks to theOwn Artinitiative which offers interest-free loans of up to £25,000 to make it “easier and more affordable for people to buy and enjoy original art and craft, regardless of their income and socioeconomic background”. With a network of nearly 300 galleries across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland,Own Arthas facilitated £75m worth of sales of contemporary art and craft to more than 83,000 people over the past 20 years. “I’m up to my eyes in Own Art payments,” jokes Glendinning, who says the scheme has been a gamechanger. “When we introduced it for the [Woolwich Contemporary Print Fair] we got at least a third more sales. Instead of paying £400 for a print upfront, you can pay £40 a month; and that’s less than a night out.” While it is human nature to hope you’ve picked up something by the next Banksy, Ramsay stresses that it is very important that people “love what they’re buying”. “They’ve got to want to live with it,” he says. “If they discover in 20 years’ time the art has gone up in value then they can feel smug about their excellent taste. Some go up. Many don’t. Investment shouldn’t be the primary aim.” London-based art dealer Miller says would-be buyers should opt for quality over quantity. Buy “one or two works a year for as much as you can afford”, he says. “If you do this, in a few years you’ll have an outstanding collection.” Occasionally you’ll make mistakes, he adds, but don’t worry. “Learn from it. You can always sell the mistake and buy something else.”",Zoe Wood,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zoewood,,lifestyle,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/12/picture-buy-art-prices-galleries-fairs

This is how we do it: ‘We’ve rediscovered the lust of our teenage years in our 60s’,,"Henry is the first person I’ve slept with since my husband of 34 years. We had a happy relationship – three sons and a good sex life. After he died a few years ago it was like I’d lost all desire for sex. I had no interest, but felt sad that a part of myself that I’d enjoyed was gone. In February this year I decided I was too young for that to be my final relationship, so I downloaded a dating app. I wasn’t expecting much, but then I saw Henry’s profile. He’d lost his wife and had three sons, like me. We met at a wine bar and had a strong connection. He invited me to his place. I said mine was closer. I had never slept with anyone on a first date – not even my husband. I was nervous. Would it be awkward? Would he need Viagra? Would I have issues with lubrication? I had saggy parts, and I felt overweight and vulnerable. But it was lovely. We kissed on the sofa, and then went to the bedroom. We’ve been seeing each other for six months now, usually every weekend and once during the week. I enjoy the ritual of getting ready when he comes over on a Friday night. I take a long shower, put on lotion – all those things that when you’re married for a long time, you don’t tend to do. We have sex several times a night, and I always have a lot of orgasms, which is new for me. I’m much more open with him than I was even with my husband. I think I was more reserved in the past. Early on, we talked a little bit about our sex lives with our spouses. Fairly quickly, I decided I didn’t want to do that: when he talked about his late wife I couldn’t help but make comparisons; I also didn’t want to have grief come into this wonderful new relationship. Grief has changed me. I’m much more in the moment than I ever was. I was always the good person: taking care of my kids and my parents, and working hard. Now I think, what the hell: let’s have sex on the first night, let’s have sex all Sunday morning. Why not? I’ve learned that life is fleeting. Henry makes me happy and the sex makes me happy, so why not have fun? I remember, after my first night with Grace, thinking to myself: wow, welcome back to the land of the living. It had been a hard few years. My wife died in 2022 – we’d been together for 35 years. She knew for the last nine months that she didn’t have long left. After about a year alone I started to think, “Maybe I’m ready to meet someone else”. I made a dating profile in February. Grace messaged me within a few days. Grace told me some of her friends thought she was crazy, taking me home on the first date, but it felt reasonable. I did think: should I get some Viagra? But it turned out to not be a problem. We started slowly and after half an hour it was really good. It’s been six months now. We have agreed that we don’t want to live together. I think living apart makes things exciting. Every time I’m going to see her, I get a feeling of anticipation and nervousness. It feels that, at the age of sixtysomething, we’ve had the opportunity to start again, with the lust of our teenage years, but all the wisdom we’ve acquired since. We have sex a lot: three or four times a day. We’ll start off on the sofa and then head for the bedroom. I’ve been amazed at how natural it has all been. Before meeting my late wife, my dating life was unsatisfying. But I think having had a long, very successful relationship gave me confidence that I hadn’t had before. It makes me really happy having Grace around. I think about her a lot when I’m not with her. And the sex, apart from being really enjoyable, reassures me that I’m not dead yet. When you reach our age, you’ve got a choice: you either start slowing down and getting old or you have to head off in a different direction. This feels like that: an entirely new chapter of my life – maybe even a new book. Would you and your partner like to share the story, anonymously, of your sex life?",Kate Lloyd,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-lloyd,,lifestyle,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/12/this-is-how-we-do-it-weve-rediscovered-the-lust-of-our-teenage-years-in-our-60s
Hamza Yassin: ‘I hang my pyjamas in the forest so the animals get used to my scent’,,"At school I was calleda “weird nerd”. When I grew up those words changed to: “You are an expert.” I don’t mind being called a geek. Own your own originality, whatever it may be – then no one can take the mickey out of you. My superpower isdyslexia. I always ask for assistance, I’m not embarrassed, I have other skills that compensate. I see the world differently and I notice everything. Growing up in SudanI didn’t know I was surrounded by nature – I was part of it. The longest river in the world, the Nile, was 800 metres from my grandma’s house. We took water from it. It was home to hippos and crocodiles, but it was part of our lives. The local kids played football with old weaver-bird nests. I didn’t realise I had a wonderful life until I came to the UK. “Grandma will be upset”was my first thought when the plane door opened in the UK. I thought someone had left the fridge door open – how else was it that cold? – and Grandma always got upset about people doing that. I was only eight. I tell peoplemy heritage is in Sudan. I was born there. But home for me is the west coast of Scotland. I remember everydetail about everyone I meet: what they wear, their jewellery, their habits. People think I’ve taken notes about them. But I’m a visual, verbal person. It’s helped me in my work. It allows me to pick up subtle nuances about an animal’s behaviour and environment. “Your otters are atthe pier, go get them” is the kind of text message I get from my neighbours, who refer to me as the “animal guy”. There was no onewho looked like me that presented wildlife shows on television. So I thought, fine, I want to be the person who filmsSteve Irwin, the person that gets up close to that crocodile at the same time Steve Irwin jumps on it. Sir David Attenboroughwas given an honorary degree from Bangor University in north Wales. So I went there, did a degree in zoology and never looked back. Many years later, I have that same honorary degree. I think of it as fate. JowitafromStrictlymassaged my feet to relieve the pain from hours of dancing. Before I didStrictlyCome Dancing, not many people knew who I was. She changed my life. She asked me for two things: my full energy and my trust. I learned more about myself than at any other time. You push yourself to the limit. I thought I would be kicked out in week one, but I was in the hands of an expert. I never say, “I wonStrictly,” I always say “we”. I’m a recluse.I’m happy on my own.

Ask Ottolenghi: is a spice grinder worth the bother or the money?,,"Grinding spices by handis hard work, and sometimes they don’t come out as finely ground as I’d like.While a spice grinder mightbe the answer,I worry that I’dspend too much time cleaning it betweendifferent spices.Cosima, Berlin, GermanyI do use a spice grinder, which I originally bought to grind coffee beans, so my advice is just to go for it. A pestle and mortar is a great tool, true (particularly if you have a granite one, with some texture, rather than a smooth one in which you end up chasing the spices around the bowl), but the spices don’t always come out finely ground, however much elbow grease you put in. After all, ready-ground spices come nowhere near toasted and ground whole spices such as cumin seeds, cinnamon sticks, star anise and so on, and the value they bring to a dish is enormous. As for maintenance, I have to confess that, so long as the rub or blend is a dry one (made from dry spices such as cumin or cloves, say, rather than raw chilli, garlic and ginger with fish sauce), my cleaning process at home is fairly superficial (at the restaurants, though, it’s another matter entirely). I usually just wipe the grinder with a clean towel or sheet of kitchen paper, and that’s pretty much it. I might put the lid through the dishwasher, but the main section holding the blade (and with the electrics in the base) I usually just give a dry wipe-down. You have to use discretion but, very often, any trace of, say, cumin will if anything add a bit of interest to the next batch of spices you blitz, anyway. So put a spice grinder on your Christmas list and don’t overthink the cleaning. Where possible, keep dry and wet mixes separate, and just pay a bit more attention to the cleaning with the latter, especially if that includes pungent garlic, chilli or ginger, for example.

"Introduce cats and dogs gradually to prevent fighting, study finds",,"The key to stopping your pets from fighting like cats and dogs may lie in how you first introduce them to each other, research suggests. People planning on taking a new puppy home to their cat should think about allowing them to get used to each other slowly, according to findings fromDogsTrust. “The advice is that it’s done really gradually,” Dr Rachel Casey, a vet and animal behaviour specialist, told the PA Media news agency. “In an ideal world, what you’d want to do is to have the cat in a situation where it can escape, it can get out of the way, so maybe somewhere high that the cat can go so it doesn’t feel threatened by the puppy.” Casey, who is also the director of strategy and transformation at Dogs Trust, added: “And what you really need to teach the puppy is to be calm in the presence of the cat.” As part of its Generation Pup research, the Dogs Trust is looking at the interaction between dogs and cats. The study found that factors such as the speed of introduction and a puppy’s age can influence their behaviour towards household felines. The research found that about one-fifth (20.1%) of pet owners introduce their new puppy to their existing cats immediately, and 18.9% do it in less than two hours. However, gradual introductions between puppies and cats significantly increased the likelihood of them getting along. According to the findings, puppies introduced to cats over more than one day – particularly those younger than 12 weeks – are calmer and more friendly, which can help form a more harmonious relationship. Casey said the vast majority of dogs showed “undesirable” behaviour when first introduced to a cat, including being aggressive, or playing with the cat when it did not want to play. Less than 10% of the puppies who were introduced to cats were calm and stayed relaxed. The Generation Pup study is the largest of its kind in the UK, with more than 9,500 puppies already enrolled, including 4,500 puppies where there is dog/cat interaction.

Or at least, a fun evening. First impressions?Tall, handsome, smiley. What did you talk about?Books. Poems. Politics. Travels. I was fascinated to hear about Rashpal’s work in prisons. We disagreed on whether Leonardo DiCaprio makes a good Romeo … Of course he does! Most awkward moment?I can be very nosy, so maybe I asked one or two questions that were overly direct. Good table manners?Excellent. He shared his pudding with me, and his pot of tea. Best thing about Rashpal?He is full of enthusiasm and has a vivid way of describing his experiences. Would you introduce Rashpal to your friends?Of course. Rashpal would enliven any social occasion. Describe Rashpal in three wordsWholehearted, genuine and open. What do you think he made of you?Curious and determined to enjoy myself (I didn’t hold back on the martinis). Did you go on somewhere?We lingered in the restaurant until we were the only people left and then I had to dash for the last train. And … did you kiss?The vibe felt more friendly than romantic – although I believe friendly is a fine place to begin. So a warm hug and a kiss on the cheek. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?Nothing – the food was delicious and the company fantastic. Marks out of 10?I can’t think of a reason not to award a 10.

The Office: this Australian remake could be mistaken for a lost series of the US show,,"In June 2005 I used methods I do not wish to disclose to watch the first fewUS episodes of The Officeon a choppy internet connection. It was a bizarrely jarring experience: I was such a fanboy of theoriginal British version(and still am: in fact I am still quite annoyed I have to specify the British version when talking about it) that I could recite entire scenes word for word. Seeing American actors – Steve Carell from Anchorman, Mindy Kaling from The 40-Year-Old Virgin, John Krasinski from absolutely nothing – doing exactly the same was unnerving. And wrong. The British beats of the show fell incorrectly out of their mouths, the interpretation of The Office as “cringe = that’s all it is!” felt like a fundamental misread, the whole thing smacked of folly. I went to university, I had sex, I got over it, and after a shaky start the US version found its stride to become arguably the biggest and most beloved sitcom that has ever existed. So … why is Australia making it again? People are going to be asking this question through all eight episodes of The Office (Australia), which debuts on Prime Video on 18 October. People have been asking this question ever since the announcement of the remake dropped last year. Fans of either version (though there are other remakes, including Quebec, Chile and Saudi Arabia) are fiercely protective of it, and that means this new take already has an uphill battle to be loved. There is an adroit adage that is impossible to find the source of online but basically goes: “People who watch The Office always ask you ‘Do you watch The Office?’ not ‘Have you watched The Office?’ because they are literally always watching The Office.” The Office, whatever version they watch, is meaningful to people. The Australian version takes its cues more from the American iteration than the British one. The Michael Scott is now Hannah Howard (Felicity Ward), the Dwight Schrute is now Lizze (Edith Poor), Jim is now Nick (Steen Raskopoulos) and Pam is now Greta (Shari Sebbens). But while the actors and first names have changed, the beats are all the same: Nick and Greta keep blushing and flirting, Hannah and Lizze have a corporal/too-dedicated-lieutenant dynamic, there’s a woman in accounts who couldn’t care less about all this, and the fact that cameras are there is never ever explained. In fact, there are all the old favourites: guy in brown suit! Warehouse manager who doesn’t like fun! Regional manager who would actually quite like them to get some work done! “Hey everybody – meeting room, five minutes”! The layout of the office is the same! The theme tune may as well be the same! They look at the camera when someone does something weird! They play pranks! An intern repeats a question he was asked in a to-camera interview! An HR seminar gets derailed! Sign up toWhat's On Get the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every Monday after newsletter promotion Both of the previous English-language series of The Office shaped the comedy landscape for ever: in the UK, nothing got made for a half-decade that wasn’t “cringe comedy”, and most straight men under the age of 40 take their linguistic tics fromRicky Gervais; in the US, the format (“There are cameras at work, two people are falling in love too slowly, everyone keeps saying ‘so … ’ instead of making an actual joke”) paved the way forParks and Recreationand, recently,Abbott Elementary. Comedy influencing more comedy is fine, “good” even – comedy influencing the exact same comedy again is a little more jarring. Watching the Australian version feels as if you’ve stumbled across an alternative universe remake that has jumped timelines into our own. On Earth-617 they are probably going crazy for this.Move past that, though – once the first couple of “here’s who everyone is, Nick and Greta haven’t kissed yet” scene-setting episodes have happened – and it’s possible to squint your eyes and imagine this is a late, lost series of the American Office, beyond even the Catherine Tate episodes. Workplaces have changed in the 11 years (!) since the end of the NBC run – the Australian version opens with a reckoning with work-from-home culture, a nod to Zoom quizzes, the reality of corporate rent, and a fairly good bit about standing desks. All that is ripe for a comedy side-glance, though why that side-glance has to be “What about The Office, but again?” is still beyond me. Next time they remake The Office, in about 16 months at this rate, maybe they’ll do something subversive with it (my pitch: they kill either Jim or Pam before they get together; the other one exists in a shock of grief for the rest of the show’s run. Also it’s in Scotland) but for now, the Australian version does exactly what you expect it to.",Joel Golby,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joel-golby,,culture,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/12/the-office-australian-remake
‘Celebrated again’: Portrait of German jazz-age pioneers lost after Nazi takeover return to Berlin,,"They could play seven instruments each, critics hailed them as the best jazz combo in 1920s Berlin, and the likes of Marlene Dietrich and Josephine Baker fought to secure them as their backing band. But after the Nazi takeover, and frustrating years of exile and internment in Australia, the legacy of Weintraubs Syncopators was lost in the mists of time. Now, 100 years after their formation, the Weimar republic’s tightest jazz band returns to the city that once adored them. Not in the flesh, but on canvas: on 21 October, a painting of the group will go on permanent display at the Jewish Museum in Berlin, after the institution acquired it from its previous owners in Canada. Painted in 1927 by Austrian artist Max Oppenheimer, the work entitledJazz bandcaptures the jagged energy of a music that was taking the German capital’s nightlife by storm in the years between the first and second world wars. Used to illustrate brochures advertising Weintraubs Syncopators concerts in the late 1920s, it shows the group as a quartet, though they frequently performed with five musicians or more. Founding duo Stefan Weintraub and Horst Graff take centre stage, here on the drums and saxophone respectively, though they would have been equally as dexterous on the piano or clarinet. “What made Weintraub’s band stand out was their versatility, both in terms of the instruments they played and the genres of music they performed,” said Albrecht Dümling, a Berlin-based historian whose book on the Syncopators’ forgotten story was published in 2022. They played not just symphonic jazz, swing and waltz, but alsoschlager –catchy German-language pop songs, back then considered wittier and more sophisticated than their boorish contemporary equivalents. Titles of their biggest hits include“My Sweetheart Wants to Take Me Sailing on Sunday”and“My Gorilla Has a Villa at the Zoo”. Friedrich Hollaender, Berlin’s most prolific cabaret composer, joined the band for a period in the 1920s and replaced Weintraub on the piano. They also performed with Josephine Baker and the Tiller Girls, and it’s no surprise that the Syncopators provided the musical strains to the defining song of the Weimar Republic’s cultural flourishing, Marlene Dietrich’s“Falling in Love Again”– as well as the other cabaret songs in Josef von Sternberg’s 1930 filmThe Blue Angel. The rise of National Socialism brought the Syncopators’ career to a halt. Though they dismissed jazz as degenerate “negro music”, the Nazis never sought a nationwide ban on the music by law, and for a few years the band continued to play Berlin venues under the Germanicised name “Die Weintraubs”. But a day after watchingthe burning of the Reichstagon 27 February 1933, the band decided to embark on an international tour from which they would never return. “Weintraubs Syncopators were never officially banned or expatriated, but since the man whose name they bore and most of their members were Jewish, their fate was clear,” said Dümling. After successful gigs in the Soviet Union and Japan, the band moved to Australia but struggled to get a foothold on the local scene due to the musician union’s opposition. In 1941, not just its German members but also Polish and Chilean nationals in its lineup were interned as enemy aliens. As Dümling discovered in the National Archives of Australia, a British officer had denounced them as Soviet spies, and for lack of proof or counter-proof for the allegations the Syncopators remained behind razor wire fencing. After the end of the war, most of the band’s members stayed in Sydney but drifted apart, some working as mechanics, others as fridge salesmen. Behind the Oppenheimer portrait of the band, however, also lie the stories of several others exiles brought about by the rise of fascism. The artist himself left Berlin in 1931, later emigrating to Switzerland and the US. Sign up toObserved Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion The painting’s owner, a prominent lawyer and amateur psychoanalyst called Hugo Staub, also left the city in a haste in mid-March 1933, the artwork staying behind at his apartment off the Kurfürstendamm. According to an affidavit signed by Staub’s son in the 1960s, none other than Hitler’s confidant Ernst “Putzi” Hanfstaengl had informed Staub that he was imminently due to be arrested as a prominent member of the League for Human Rights. What happened to the painting over the course of the war and first postwar years is unclear, but in 1962 the artwork was auctioned off to a former Berlin property developer living in exile in Canada. For half a century, it adorned family living rooms in Montreal and Ottawa, before being loaned to the National Gallery of Canada and finally sold to the Jewish Museum in Berlin. “There came a point where I thought it would be good for these musicians to be celebrated again where they came from,” said Ruth Freiman, whose uncle purchased the painting in 1962. The exchange took place with the permission of the descendants of the painting’s first owner Hugo Staub, who received an ex gratia payment as part of the sale. The various families and individuals tied together by Oppenheimer’s painting are set to attend its unveiling in Berlin on 21 October. “There’s an enormous sense of completion”, said Michael Fisher, a Zurich-based Australian whose father Emanuel and uncle Addy were part of the Syncopators’ final lineup before their dissolution. “To see the band return to the city they left behind the day after the Reichstag fire means the world to me.”",Philip Oltermann,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/philip-oltermann,2024-10-12,culture,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/oct/13/nazi-looted-portraits-german-jazz-age-pioneers-berlin-weimar-cabaret
Salem’s Lot review – anaemic adaptation of Stephen King’s 70s vampire novel,,"It’s an ingenious, shapeshifting entity, the vampire movie; a genre that lends itself to layers of symbolism and subtext. FromTheTwilightSaga’s syrupy themes of adolescent romantic yearning to the bruising loneliness of a bullied child inLet the Right One Inand the revisionist political history and absurdity ofEl Conde– featuring an undead incarnation of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet – the vampire film is rarely just about vampires. Which is why Gary Dauberman’s film adaptation ofSalem’s Lot, based onthe 1975 Stephen King novelthat spawned two TV miniseries and pop cultural references galore, feels almost radical in its total lack of ambition, scope and depth. It’s an old-school tale of an epidemic of the undead in a small town in rural Maine. And that’s it. No underlying meaning, no knotty themes to unpick. For audiences who have come to expect a little more intellectual bite from their vampire flicks, this is pallid, bloodless stuff. Two new arrivals set the sleepy town of Salem’s Lot astir. Author Ben Mears (Lewis Pullman), linked to the community by a childhood tragedy, has returned to research his next project. And antique shop proprietor RT Straker (Pilou Asbaek) is a recent immigrant to the US (from a previous century, judging by his cravats and florid acting style). Straker has a smile that could strip furniture polish and an accent that sounds as though it was disinterred from a mitteleuropean plague pit. But when kids start vanishing, it’s Mears who bears the brunt of local hostility – his relationship with town sweetheart Susan (Makenzie Leigh) might be a factor. The 70s backdrop is a little too neat and antiseptic to be fully convincing, but the main issue is a clumsy screenplay that laboriously overexplains while also playing out as if vital plot points have been lost along the way. The vampire genre is, like its toothy protagonists, notoriously difficult to kill outright, but this flat and uninspired film could be a nail in its coffin.

On my radar: Evan Dando’s cultural highlights,,"Evan Dando was born in Essex, Massachusetts, in 1967 and moved to Boston aged nine. In 1986 he co-founded alt-rock band the Lemonheads (initially known as the Whelps), putting out four albums before their 1992 breakthroughIt’s a Shame About Rayand hit cover of Mrs Robinson. The band has since released another five albums and Dando a solo 2003 record entitledBaby I’m Bored. Dando now lives in Brazil with his partner, video-maker Antonia Teixeira. He plays La Belle Angele in Edinburgh on 16 October, touring the UK until the end of the month. Elis & Tom (Dir Roberto de Oliveira, Jom Tob Azulay) I went to the premiere of this documentary in São Paulo last year, about Elis Regina and Tom Jobim [Brazilian musicians who released the bossa nova albumElis & Tomin 1974]. It’s definitely the happiest music – Waters of March is one of the best songs in the world – and the film was great. There were no subtitles at the premiere but I just let it wash over me. The director had the footage for ages and he finally decided to put it together. I’m very glad he did. Bar Pitti, New York This is just my favourite little restaurant. It’s right for any mood, you can go in there and always find something you want. It’s a calm and peaceful place with amazing food. I usually get the gnocchi or the minestrone soup. Last time I got pasta carbonara – they make their own pasta and it’s really delicious. Italian food is not too fattening. Well, it can be, but this is a really ideal place to go if you want to chill and eat great food and just have the New York experience. I recommend it really highly. yyyyyyy.info Oh, man, this website is totally weird. I found out about it on some YouTube video last year and I keep getting people to check it out. It’s complete mayhem – layers of different colours and random text and crazy pictures and weird music – but it’s awesome. It’s different every time you go in, and if you click on something it’ll send you on a journey. I can’t tell whether it’s some surveillance thing or an art thing or, like, a satanic cult, but it’s everything you want a website to be. As arcane as it gets. Lucy Lucy is a project by a guy called Cooper B Handy, who also plays guitar in the Taxidermists. He’s done all these crazy tapes and a few years back he started messing with an 808 drum machine and putting out more electronic stuff.Best of Lucywas the first tape I got. It’s fantastic. The songs are all short, like a minute thirty, and they’re anthemic – he writes really catchy tunes. He’s playing the Camden Assembly in London on 30 October – unfortunately we’re playing the same night in Islington so I’ll miss it. Journey to the End of the Night byCéline Céline was a horrible person later in life – a collaborationist, an antisemite – but I loved this book. I read it when I was younger and listened to it again recently on Audible. It’s just so good – ahead of its time and so funny. You laugh out loud a lot. It’s a semi-autobiographical story of a medical student’s experience in the first world war and all the horrors he encounters then and afterwards. Reading it, you can’t believe it was written in the 1930s. Things weren’t that different back then – that’s the scary part. Liar’s Club, Chicago I think this is one of the five best bars in the world. I started going in the 2000s and I’ve never stopped. I’ve seen a lot of great music there – DJs and live acts – and I’ve played there a few times as well. It’s a rock’n’roll bar with black walls and crazy red lights that make it look like Christmas all the time and punk memorabilia everywhere. It’s a really special place. If you’re in Chicago, you’ve got to go.

"Al Pacino on the inside story of The Godfather: ‘I was told, you’re not cutting it’",,"One day in the middle of the afternoon, I got a phone call. On the other end of the line, I heard the name and the voice of the director who would change my life:Francis Ford Coppola. First, he told me he was going to be directing The Godfather. I thought he might be fantasising. What was he talking about? How did they give him The Godfather? I had read Mario Puzo’s novel, which had become a big hit; it was a huge deal for anyone to be involved with it. But when you’re a young actor you don’t even put your eyes on those things. Just getting any part in a film is a miracle. Opportunities like those don’t exist for you. It just seemed so outrageous. And then I thought: Hey, maybe this is possible. I had spent time with Francis in San Francisco. He was a leader, a doer and a risk taker. I saw that he carried himself with confidence, and that gave me faith in him. But this wasn’t a thing that was done at the time. Wouldn’t the studio, Paramount, go to older directors who had reputations, not this talented, young avant-garde intellectual? It didn’t fit with my perception of Hollywood. Then Francis said he wanted me to play Michael Corleone. I thought, Now he’s gone too far. I started doubting whether he was on the phone at all. Maybe I was the one going through a nervous breakdown. For a director to offer you a role, over the phone, not through an agent or anything, and this role of all roles – that was a hundred-million-to-one shot. Who was I, to have this fall into my lap? When I finally hung up the phone with Francis, I was kind of in a daze. Paramount didn’t want me to play Michael Corleone. They wanted Jack Nicholson. They wanted Robert Redford. They wanted Warren Beatty or Ryan O’Neal. In the book, Puzo had Michael calling himself “the sissy of the Corleone family”. He was supposed to be small, dark-haired, handsome in a delicate way, no visible threat to anybody. That didn’t sound like the guys that the studio wanted. But that didn’t mean it had to be me. It did mean, however, that I would have to screen-test for the role, which I had never done before, and that I would have to fly out to the west coast to do it, which I just didn’t want to do. I did not care that it wasThe Godfather. I was a bit afraid of flying and I didn’t want to go to California. But my manager, Marty Bregman, said to me, “You’re getting on that fucking plane.” He brought me a pint of whiskey so I could drink it on the flight, and I got there. Paramount had already rejected Francis’s entire cast. They rejectedJimmy CaanandBob Duvall, who were great established actors, well on their way to what they would become. They rejectedBrando, for Christ’s sake. It was quite clear walking into the studio that they didn’t want me either. And I knew I wasn’t the only one being considered. Many of the young actors of the day were reading for Michael. That was an unpleasant feeling. Before I even did my screen test, Francis took me to a barber in San Francisco, because he wanted Michael to have an authentic 1940s haircut. The barber heard that we were making the film and actually stepped back, took it in, and started shaking. We found out later that he had a heart attack. Word was out that there was a lot riding on this film behind the scenes. Paramount executives were irate with one another and having shouting matches. You could feel the tension everywhere. So I did my Zen “this too shall pass” thing. I said to myself, Go to the character. What is going on in the scene? Where are you going? Where did you come from? Why are you here? I sat through a few days’ worth of screen tests wearing an early version of Michael’s army uniform and a hangdog expression on my face. I always had that look. I guess it was a facade that I carried with me, because it got me through everything. But I must say the scene I was asked to do was not the best one they could have picked. It was Michael, in the opening wedding scene, explaining to his girlfriend, Kay, what his family really did and who all the players were in his father’s operation. It was a mundane scene of exposition, just me andDiane Keatonsitting at a drab little table, drinking glasses of water we pretended were wine, while I talked about Sicilian wedding customs. My interpretation of Michael was like planting a garden; it would take a certain amount of time in the story for the flowers to grow. How am I supposed to bring across my ideas about him in this scene? I couldn’t bring him to life in this scene because nobody could. But here’s the secret: Francis wanted me. He wanted me and I knew that. And there’s nothing like when a director wants you. He also gave me a gift in the form of Diane Keaton. He had a few actors he was auditioning for the role of Kay, but the fact that he wanted to pair me up with Diane suggested she had an edge in the process. I knew she was doing well in her career and had been appearing on Broadway in shows like Hair and Play It Again, Sam with Woody Allen. A few days before the screen test, I met Diane in Lincoln Center in New York City at a bar, and we just hit it off. She was easy to talk to and funny, and she thought I was funny too. I felt like I had a friend and an ally right away. When I knew I had the role for sure, I called my grandmother to tell her. “You know I’m going to be in The Godfather? I’m going to play the part of Michael Corleone.” She said, “Oh, Sonny, listen! Grandad was born in Corleone, that’s where he was from.” I didn’t know where my grandfather was born, only that he came from Sicily – once my grandfather got to America and no one was chasing after him, he left it at that. Now to learn he came from Corleone, the very town that gave my character and his family their name? I thought, I must be getting help from somewhere, because how else could such an impossible thing – me getting the role – happen in the first place? I still had to figure out who Michael was to me. Before filming started, I would take long walks up and down Manhattan, from 91st Street to the Village and back, just thinking about how I was going to play him. Mostly I’d go alone, other times I’d meet my friend Charlie Laughton downtown and we’d walk back uptown together. Michael starts out from a young man we’ve seen before, getting by, a little loopy, a little lumpy. He’s there and not there at the same time. It’s all building up to when he volunteers to take out Virgil Sollozzo and Capt McCluskey, the drug dealer and the crooked cop who conspired to kill Vito Corleone, Michael’s father. All of a sudden, there’s a big explosion in him. This is mapped out in the novel, because a book can give the narrative as much time as it needs. You wait and see how it unfolds. But what was I going to do in the film? Before we started shooting, I got together with Little Al Lettieri, who was going to play Sollozzo. He just said to me, “You should meet this guy. It’s good for what you’re doing.” I sort of knew what he meant by that, so I went along with him. One day we took a drive to a suburb just outside the city. Little Al brought me to a traditional, beautiful, well-kept home. He took me inside and introduced me to the head of the household, a guy who looked like a normal businessman. I shook his hand and said hello, and he was very welcoming. He had a loving family. He had a wife who served us drinks and light snacks on fine porcelain. He had two young sons around my age. I was just some crazy actor who had come into his house, trying to absorb as much as I could. Our conversation remained polite and at the surface level. I never asked Little Al why he had brought me here, but I thought about what he had said before we came, how this visit would be helpful for what I was working on. Little Al knew some guys. Some real guys. And now he was introducing me to one of them. I was being given a taste of how this thing looked and operated in reality, not how it was shown in the movies. Not that our host was going to get into any of those details with us. As a matter of fact, we ended up drinking and playing games. Many moons later, photos from that night surfaced, showing me in a sweatshirt, laughing away with a drink in my hand, while Little Al showed me a gun. A boys’ night out. I was a kid from the South Bronx. I am an Italian. I am a Sicilian too. I knew what it was to always be assumed that you had at least a connection to organised crime. Any name that ended with a vowel was scrutinised for having possible connections to that world. Instead of being compared to Joe DiMaggio, you were associated with Al Capone. Most of us will never experience crime, let alone perpetrate it. And yet we’re fascinated with these people who are determined not to live within the rules of society, who are finding another way to go. The outlaw is a particularly American kind of character. We grew up pretending to be Jesse James and Billy the Kid. These were folk heroes. They became part of our lore. The history of the mafia is part of that lore too. My filming on the Godfather began with its opening wedding sequence, which took about a week out in Staten Island. From my humble day-to-day life, I found myself plunged into the set of a huge Hollywood film, filled with equipment, hot lights and dolly tracks, cranes and booms, microphones hovering overhead, and a company of actors with hundreds of extras, all working under Francis’s direction. Diane and I spent those first days laughing with each other, having to perform that opening wedding exposition scene from the screen test that we hated so much. On the basis of just that one scene, we were certain we were in the worst picture ever made, and when we’d finish shooting for the day, we would go back to Manhattan and get drunk. Our careers were over, we thought. Back in Hollywood, Paramount started to look at the film that Francis had shot, and they were once again questioning whether I was the right actor for the part. The rumour had got out around the set that I was going to be let go from the picture. You could feel that loss of momentum when we shot. There was a discomfort among people, even the crew, when I was working. I was very conscious of that. The word was that I was going to be fired, and, likely, so was the director. Not that Francis wasn’t cutting it – I wasn’t. But he was the one responsible for me being in the film. Finally, Francis determined that something had to be done. One night he called me to meet him at the Ginger Man, a restaurant and watering hole for thirsty Lincoln Center types, where actors, dancers, maestros, and stagehands all lined up at the bar. He was having dinner there with his wife, his kids and a small group, and when I went in and found him at his table, he said, “Listen, I want to talk to you a minute.” He didn’t invite me to sit down with them. I stood there wondering, What’s he doing? He’s cutting his steak and looking at me like I’m not part of anything – like I’m just some isolated actor who had come looking for a handout. Finally, Francis said, “You know how much you mean to me, how much faith I had in you.” At this point we had been shooting The Godfather for about a week and a half. And Francis said, “Well, you’re not cutting it.” I felt that one in the pit of my stomach. It’s when it finally hit me that my job was on the line. I said to Francis, “What do we do here?” He said, “I put together rushes of what we’ve shot already. Why don’t you take a look at it yourself? Because I don’t think it’s working. You’re not working.” I went into a screening room the next day. And when I looked at the footage, all scenes from very early in the film, I thought to myself, I don’t think there’s anything spectacular here. I didn’t know what to make of it. But the effect was certainly what I wanted. I didn’t want to be seen. My whole plan for Michael was to show that this kid was unaware of things and wasn’t coming on with a personality that was particularly full of charisma. My idea was that this guy comes out of nowhere. That was the power of this characterization. That was the only way this could work: the emergence of this person, the discovery of his capacity and his potential. By the end of the film, I hoped that I would have created an enigma. And I think that’s what Francis was hoping for also. But neither one of us knew how to explain it to the other.

The jury’s out on whether he did that deliberately, and Francis himself has denied that he orchestrated it for my benefit, but he did move up the filming of the Italian restaurant scene, where the untested Michael comes to take his revenge on Sollozzo and McCluskey. That scene was not meant to be filmed until a few days later, but if something hadn’t happened to let me show what I was capable of, there might not have been a later for me. So over the course of an April night I shot that scene. I spent 15 hours that day in a tiny restaurant, with Little Al Lettieri and the magnificent Sterling Hayden, who played McCluskey. The two of them truly were precious to me. They knew I was going through a difficult time, feeling like I had the world on my shoulders, knowing that any day the axe could fall on me. Here we were in a dead, fetid room that was being filled with smoke and hellish heat – we had no trailers to escape to, no production assistants coming up and asking, “Can we get you some water?” None of that. I was just sitting there, thinking, How do you stand this stuff? The absolute ennui of it could actually kill you. Sterling and Al Lettieri helped keep up my morale; they set a tone and were role models for me. But eventually the script called for me to excuse myself to use the bathroom, find a hidden gun, and blow their brains out. Then I had to run out of the restaurant and make my escape by jumping on to a moving car. I had no stand-in. I had no stuntman. I had to do it myself. I jumped, and I missed the car. Now I was lying in a gutter on White Plains Road in the Bronx, flat on my back and looking up at the sky. I had twisted my ankle so badly that I couldn’t move. Everyone on the crew had crowded around me. They were trying to lift me up, asking me: Was my ankle broken? Could I walk? I didn’t know. I lay there thinking, This is a miracle. Oh God, you’re saving me. I don’t have to do this picture any more. I was shocked by the feeling of relief that passed over me. Showing up for work every day, feeling unwanted, feeling like an underling, was an oppressive experience, and this injury could be my release from that prison. At least now they could fire me, recast another actor as Michael, and not lose every dime they’d already put into the picture. But that’s not what happened. They filmed the rest of the car-jumping scene with a stunt guy who appeared out of nowhere, and they shot my ankle up with cortisone until I could stand on my feet again. Then Francis showed the restaurant scene to the studio, and when they looked at it, something was there. Because of that scene I just performed, they kept me in the film. So I didn’t get fired from The Godfather. I just kept doing what I did, what I had thought about on those lonely walks up and down the length of Manhattan. I did have a plan, a direction that I really believed was the way to go with this character. And I was certain that Francis felt the same way. Ihad been introduced toMarlon Brandobriefly at a dinner with all the cast members before we started filming. Now, as we were getting ready to do the scene where Michael finds Vito in the hospital, Francis said, “Why don’t you and Brando have lunch together?” This was going to be the big talk. I actually didn’t want to talk to him. I thought it was not necessary. The discomfort I felt at just the thought of it – You mean I have to have lunch with him? Seriously, it fucking scared me. He was the greatest living actor of our time. I grew up on actors like him – larger than life people like Clark Gable and Cary Grant. They were famous when fame meant something, before the bloom went off the rose. But Francis said you have to and so I did. I had my lunch with Marlon in a modest room in the hospital where we were filming on 14th Street. He was sitting on one hospital bed, I was sitting on the other. He was asking me questions: Where am I from? How long have I been an actor? And he was eating chicken cacciatore with his hands. His hands were full of red sauce. So was his face. And that’s all I could think about the whole time. Whatever his words were, my conscious mind was fixated by the stain-covered sight in front of me. He was talking – gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble – and I was just mesmerised. What was he going to do with the chicken? I hoped he wasn’t going to tell me to throw it in the garbage for him. He disposed of it somehow without getting up. He looked at me in a quizzical way, as if to ask, What are you thinking about? I was wondering, What is he going to do with his hands? Should I get him a napkin? Before I could, he spread both his hands across the white hospital bed and smeared the sheets with red sauce, without even thinking about it, and he kept on talking. And I thought, Is that how movie stars act? You can do anything. When our lunch was over, Marlon looked at me with those gentle eyes of his and said, “Yeah, kid, you’re gonna be all right.” I was taught to be polite and grateful, so I probably just said thank you to him. I was too scared to say anything at all. What I should have said was “Can you define ‘all right’?” What I think audiences received from The Godfather, what brought it across and really gave it its impact, was this idea of family. People identified with the Corleones, saw themselves somehow in them, and found themselves connecting to the characters and their dynamics as brothers and sisters, parents and children. The film had Mario Puzo’s exciting drama and storytelling, the magic of Coppola’s interpretation, and real violence. But in the context of that family, it all became something else. It wasn’t just people from the city who related to the Corleones – that sense of familiarity carried the film to every part of the world. Marlon showed me generosity, too, but I don’t think he saved it all for me, because he shared it with the audience. It’s what made his performance so memorable and so endearing. We all fantasise about having someone like Don Vito we can turn to. So many people are abused in this life, but if you’ve got a Godfather, you’ve got someone you can go to, and they will take care of it. That’s why people responded to him in the film. It was more than just the bravado and the boldness; it was the humanity underneath it. That’s why he had to play Vito larger than life – his physical size, the shoe polish in his hair, the cotton in his cheeks. His Godfather had to be an icon, and Brando made him as iconic as Citizen Kane or Superman, Julius Caesar or George Washington. But Francis had a lot on his shoulders, as I would learn when we were working on the funeral sequence for Vito. It was a big scene we shot out on Long Island that involved a large amount of the cast and took a couple of days. The sun was going down and I heard “Wrap! Wrap!” They told me I was done for the day. So naturally I’m happy because I get to go home and have some fun, whatever that means. I was on the way to my trailer saying to myself, Well, I didn’t fuck up too much. I had no lines, no obligations, and that was fine. As I was heading back, I began to hear the sound of someone crying, which you sort of expect in a graveyard. I looked around to see where it was coming from. And there, sitting on a tombstone, was Francis Ford Coppola bawling like a baby. Profusely crying. Nobody was going near him, so I went up to him, and I said, “Francis, what’s wrong? What happened?” He wiped his eyes with his sleeve, paused, looked up at me, and said, “They won’t give me another shot.” He had wanted to film another setup that day, and he had not been allowed it. Even he had to answer to someone else. And he wanted this so badly that to have it denied had actually wounded him. One never knows if a film is going to be great. But there in that graveyard I thought, If this is the kind of passion that Francis has for it, then something here is working. I knew I was in good hands. Before the Godfather had its premiere in New York, I had seen it only once, a few months earlier, when Francis had shown me an unfinished cut. At the end of that screening, I gave Francis notes on my performance, and he looked at me with an expression of quasi-disgust. Of course when I’m looking at an unfinished film, I can’t help seeing things that I might do differently. But you’d think I would understand that it was not my place to say this to the director of the film, who had just spent the last year of his life dangling from the edge of a cliff by his fingernails to get it made. I was insensitive: he had the grace to show it to me and I came in worried about my performance and not the great film he had made. Sometimes you’re a little unconscious as a young actor. You have other things on your mind, and all forms of grace and etiquette go out the window due to your vain impulses and stupid ego. I’ve seen it in others, I must say. I hope I’m not still that way, but the jury’s out on that one. Back in 1972, the effect that the film’s release had on me was immediate. It happened at light speed. Everything changed. A few weeks after it came out, I was walking on the street and a middle-aged woman came up to me and kissed my hand and called me “Godfather”. Another time, I went into a grocery store to get a container of coffee to go while Charlie waited for me outside on the sidewalk. And a woman approached him and asked, “Is thatAl Pacino?” He said to her, “Yeah.” She said, “Oh, really? He’s Al Pacino?” He said to her, “Well, somebody’s gotta be.” The film had not been out that long, so I continued to go about my normal daily life as if nothing had changed. One day I was standing at a kerb, waiting for the light to change, and this pretty redhead was standing there with me. I looked at her. She looked at me. I said, “Hi.” She said, “Hi, Michael.” And I just went, Whoa. Oh my God. I am not safe. Anonymity, sweet pea, the light of my life, my survival tool – that’s gone now.

Lock up your TV remote! Why Jilly Cooper’s Rivals was guaranteed to be joyous television,,"It begins, of course, with bonking. A closeup on a bare male bottom, thrusting energetically in a Concorde loo. Cries of ecstasy float over a soundtrack of Robert Palmer’s Addicted to Love as the plane hits supersonic and the flight attendant pops the champagne. It can only beJilly Cooper, and that bottom can only be Rupert Campbell-Black – champion show jumper, international heart-throb, Tory sports minister, braying toff, absolute shit. Lock up your telly remote, because Rivals – that most gloriously 1980s piece of doorstopper fiction, Blighty’s answer to Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities – has landed on our screens. Full disclosure. I am a Jilly Cooper super fan. Dame Jilly is my heroine, and Rivals would be my Desert Island Discs book of choice. I took my daughter’s name, Pearl, from one of her books. So ardent is my love for Jilly that I applied to be an extra on this TV adaptation of Rivals. (Sadly it didn’t work out.) In fact,I have written about Jilly before. When that article – more of a love letter, if I’m honest – was published, she sent me a handwritten, two-page thank-you note, addressed to “Darling, darling Jess” which is preserved as a treasure in my scrapbook, along with my wedding photos and my children’s first drawings. I am not making this up. Cooper’s novels have bottoms on the covers (Riders, an absolute peach in white jodhpurs) and exclamation marks in their titles (Jump!) and she is therefore belittled as a writer. Which is a travesty, because her emotional intelligence is second to none. There is no one better on the worlds that exist within a marriage. No one sharper on the dynamics of a dinner party. Much of what I know about life, I learned from Jilly. She is generous and wise, wrapping morality tales in a buttery pastry of sex and puns and parties. And she is hilarious, the queen of the delicious takedown. No one – perhaps Jane Austen, on a good day – understands better the very English art of getting away with being rude about people by being funny about it. I am not, by the way, the only person who thinks all this. In 2017 Cooper was the subject of a 3,700-word appreciation in the London Review of Books by Cambridge academic Dr Ian Patterson, in which he compared her world-building skills as a novelist to Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope and Zadie Smith. What everyone does know about Jilly Cooper is the sex. “As he slid inside her, she felt all the amazed joy of a canal lock suddenly finding it can accommodate the QE2” is not a line Dickens would have come up with. And now that Rivals is on TV, there is sex everywhere: at the office, on top of pianos, on piles of coats at parties. Cooper adores sex, and having crushes, and gossiping about sex, and having people fancy you. She reminds me of another blond heroine of mine, Donatella Versace, in her red-lipsticked feminine lust for the erotic. (Cooper was one of the first popular novelists to make casual mention of vibrators.) When it was published, Rivals was infamous for how bountiful the sex was, but watching it on screen in 2024 you notice how fun – how wholesome, even – it is. Everyone is just having a lovely time, lots of orgasms, none of the choking and hair-pulling of aggressive internet pornography. Early in the first episode, we see Rupert’s bottom, again, because he is playing tennis naked, which feels more Famous Five than Fifty Shades of Grey. It was a simpler time, when a grooming routine meant lying in the sun until you were conker brown, “trimming your bush” with nail scissors (a world innocent of the Brazilian wax!) and splashing on the Fracas or Calèche fragrance your lover brought you from duty free. Buck’s fizz and shepherd’s pie. Wham! and Paul Simon. Long boozy lunches and smoking indoors. The trill of a landline, the thwack of a Filofax. Lady in Red as the big end-of-night tune. Rivals is a time capsule which this mini-series captures to perfection. And for all the money-shots of honey-coloured Cotswold stone mansions (plenty of those, don’t worry) its world of 20th-century wealth is brash and flash in a way which, in a post-Succession age, feels almost quaint. The calibration of wealth was of a different order before the hyperscaling of the last three decades. In Rivals’ Rutshire, rich men show off their wealth with cigars, not private jets; expense accounts, not offshore ones. There is no question that Rivals is deeply problematic. For a start, there is a general assumption that domineering, rude men are the hottest kind of men. Cooper did not invent this trope – hello, Mr Darcy – but still, one does flinch a little when Campbell-Black, played by Alex Hassell, says to his beloved, “Darling, you know I love you to bits, but never tell me what to do.” Sexism is simply accepted as a fact of life. Campbell’s idea of a compliment is to say admiringly, “With looks like hers, I wouldn’t have thought a career was that important.” But – aside from Rupert C-B, who gets a free pass because he is just so divine looking, darling – Cooper is ruthless in her skewering of the male ego as a wrecking ball, as destructive to home life as it is in a boardroom. David Tennant is deliciously watchable as Lord Baddingham, all huge but fragile ego. And then there is the casual racism, present in the book and on screen. A modicum of diversity has been added to the cast for Rivals’ television outing, but only barely, and the wall-to-wall whiteness of many scenes feels jarring. For the most part, the moral hemline has been let down by an inch or two in the journey to screen – just enough to head off outrage. The age differential between Taggie (20) and Rupert (nearly twice that) is skated over, helped by Sex Education’s Bella Maclean playing Taggie as a little less wet than she is in the original. In the book, political correctness is a punchline. Guardian readers are grumpy oddballs. For a modern television audience, the dial has been nudged a notch or two in the progressive direction. The central storyline in the novel is about competition between … television franchises, I think? It really wasn’t the point, and the details escape me. Anyway, the machinations of terrestrial television don’t scream white-hot centre of power these days, so the 2024 version focuses on the prospect of powerful people being brought down by what they say on television, which has a certain relevance in the age of Prince Andrew on Newsnight and Joe Biden’s presidential debate. There is a scene in another Cooper book when a woman is described as being “so blonde and beautiful, with such wonderful brown breasts after a week in Portugal, that no one minded her breastfeeding at all”. At times, like here, the mores of this world seem pure comedy. I mean, you might as well try to cancel Blackadder. But not all of it feels harmless. I wish that when I had first read this book as a teenage girl, I had understood that giving their weight in stone and pounds – with seven and a half stone being the ideal – was a weird way to describe women. The stark body shaming has gone, for television, but the mood music remains. At a buffet, we will be given a closeup of what a character puts on their plate, seemingly in an invitation to judge them on it. Only now this treatment is meted out, equal opportunities style, to men as well as women. The nuance of Jilly Cooper is that the joke is not always on who it appears to be. Take the rampant snobbery. Being called Sharon or Trevor is hilarious in Rivals. So are regional accents. And – well, adultery is one thing, but saying lounge instead of sitting room! Beyond the pale. Oh, and imagine the shame of having a crescent-shaped flower bed with red and yellow flowers in it, instead of honeysuckle and roses and a walled garden! Can you even? Cooper knows this world and all its labyrinthine unwritten rules. Dogs, for instance, must be black labradors or scruffy mongrels, and never, under any circumstances, anything smaller than a cocker spaniel. Yet – no spoilers – snobs get their comeuppance in the end, in Jilly’s world. Is the Rivals worldview sexist and racist and classist? Yes. Were those good things? No. But was that world Jilly’s fault? No, it was the fault of patriarchy and global systems of inequality. Don’t try to lay it on my Jilly, just for telling it like it is. Is Rivals good TV? Listen, I’m clearly the wrong person to ask, what with the whole hero-worship thing. I can tell you that the fashion is a riot: especially Cameron Cook, played by Nafessa Williams, who looks as if she’s wearing Yves Saint Laurent when everyone else is in Dorothy Perkins. And don’t get me started on the amazing hair. Or the moustaches. Oh, and the party scenes are a joy. I defy you to watch Patrick’s 21st and not think, wow, We Don’t Have to Take Our Clothes Off is abanger. Man, I wish I could have been an extra in that scene. The heart wants what it wants. Jilly simply adores Rupert Campbell-Black, despite his many faults. And I feel the same way about Jilly.

"‘My body is broken, but I’m not going to give up’: Hanif Kureishi on life after the accident that paralysed him",,"“Iwasn’t even pissed,”Hanif Kureishisays, as if somehow that would have made it better. The writer is talking about the accident that left him a tetraplegic. Or, as he likes to call himself with classic Kureishian brutality, a vegetable. Though he’s not. His body may be broken, but his brain isn’t. It was Boxing Day 2022 and he was in Italy. Back then the writer spent half his idyllic life in Rome, half in London. His three sons were adult and independent, he had enough money to enjoy a good life, he was in love with his wife, Isabella d’Amico, and, at the age of 68, the enfant terrible of English literature was content in a way he’d never been. He was having a beer, watching the football on his iPad, when he had a dizzy spell. He stood up, took a few steps forwards and fainted. He later discovered he had fallen on his head and broken his neck. Kureishi was left paralysed. Would it have made any difference if he had been pissed? “I could have reproached myself more. You seek some kind of explanation; some kind of finality. Why has it happened to me?” At the London Spinal Cord Injury Centre, where he was transferred after spending a year in Italian and English hospitals, he was surrounded by people asking themselves the same question. Virtually all had suffered horrific fluke injuries resulting in broken necks. “Some twat had fallen out of bed and broken his neck. Some other twat had fallen down the stairs and broken his neck.” Twat, in Kureishi’s lexicon, is not an insult – just a synonym for person. “A nice guy tripped over a rake in his garden and broke his neck. So everybody in there is thinking, what the fuck? One guy, a close friend of mine, a political philosopher and rock climber, fell on his head and was paralysed from the neck down.” Kureishi’s neck break is partial. He still has feeling and movement in his limbs, though he cannot walk or grip with his hands. Kureishi thought his life was over. For starters, he thought he might die. Then, if he did survive, what was the point? He could no longer do anything for himself. The man who had lived a life of belligerent, cussed independence, doing what the hell he wanted when the hell he wanted, was now wholly dependent on others for everything. Almost two years on, he has written a book about the accident and life afterwards. With apt and typical directness, it’s called Shattered. And Kureishi has been in every way. As a writer, he is known for a different kind of shattering – of taboos. He made his name as the screenwriter of Stephen Frears’s 1985 romcomMy Beautiful Laundrette,though romcom suggests a tweeness at odds with the reality. It featured a gay love affair (a rarity 40 years ago) between a young Anglo-Pakistani man and a white skinhead with a history of racist violence (Daniel Day-Lewis in his breakthrough role). The film was a groundbreaking mix of romance, racism and identity politics. Kureishi was nominated for a best original screenplay Oscar. His next film, Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, portrayed a British man of Pakistani ancestry and a white woman in an open marriage, against the backdrop of London lit up by riots. Kureishi’s first and best known novel,The Buddha of Suburbia, is a thinly disguised fictionalisation of his own upbringing that caused huge upset in his family. His 1998 novella Intimacy told the story of a young man leaving his wife and two young sons, with coruscating candour – Kureishi had just left his wife and two sons. There wasn’t a scab from his private life not worth picking over in his fiction. Kureishi’s subjects were belonging (and not belonging) and transgression. He was calculatedly transgressive. His screenplay for My Son the Fanatic tackled Muslim fundamentalism in 1997, while The Mother is a film about a woman in her mid-60s (played by Anne Reid) initiating an affair with a man in his early 30s (Daniel Craig). Nothing was unsayable or undoable in Kureishi’s work. And it still isn’t. Shattered is exuberantly scatological, soaked in the catheterised piss and enema-extracted shit of his new life. It is also a tribute to those who have helped him through the worst of it; a prolonged screech of injustice; an exploration of dependency in which he portrays himself as half baby, half tyrant; and a defiant fist pump for survival. We meet at the home he shares with d’Amico, an Italian literary publicist, in west London. His 24-hour-a-day care worker Camilla opens the door. Kureishi is waiting for me in the living room. His electric wheelchair is state of the art, with tyres fit for a 4x4. There are any number of prints framed on the walls – a John Lennon photo here, a Rembrandt self-portrait there, anIngresnude, family pics, a miniature Alex Ferguson in a tiny glass cup on the mantelpiece (he is an avid Manchester United fan). In the corner is the hospital bed he sleeps on. Kureishi is wearing a sloppy purple jumper and baggy tracksuit bottoms. He used to pride himself on his style, but tells me it’s pointless wearing a smart pair of trousers when you can’t walk. He is warm and curious, wanting to know about life at the Guardian, what else I get up to, which football team I support. He asks if I’d mind sitting on the sofa so he can position his wheelchair to look at me when we chat. Camilla brings him a black coffee with a straw, and a beaker of water. The house is large, on three storeys, but Kureishi tells me he’s not seen the second and third floors since the accident. He is confined to the living room and kitchen, and it frustrates the hell out of him. Having said that, he’s much more positive than he has been, largely because he’s back working. “Most people with spinal injuries never work again. If you’re a ski instructor or a lorry driver, you’re fucked. I met a lot of people in hospital with spinal injuries. They go home, but what they do at home is just watch the TV – they can’t work. Their lives are over.” He’s lucky to be a writer, he says – though he has had to learn a new way of writing that requires huge patience, both for him and those helping. It was only a couple of days after the accident that he started writing again. He was desperate to find out if he could still do it. So he dictated his thoughts to d’Amico. “She would sit on the end of the bed taking dictation. It was madness. I was shouting at her, yelling, half-dead.” Why was he yelling? “Urgency. I had this very strong desire to say something. To see if I could go back to being a writer. I was bombed out of my head on all kinds of shit, but I wanted to find out whether I was still the same person. We did a blog every day. Then the kids came over to Rome and my son Carlo brought his computer, and we started publishing them onSubstack.” He talks me through the process. “I’d lie in bed and write the blog in my head, and would see the order of the thoughts. I’d try to memorise the sentences so when Isabella or my boys came [Kureishi has 30-year-old twins Carlo and Sachin with film producer Tracey Scoffield, and Kier, 26, with psychologist Monique Proudlove], I could just dictate it straight to them. I had to learn how to write in this completely new way.” What surprised him, and gave him such hope, was that when they published the blogs on Substack, people wanted to read them. Hundreds, then thousands, then tens of thousands. He realised this was a subject that people wanted to hear about. What’s more, they wanted to hear about it from him. Carlo effectively became his editor. “He’d tell me I’d missed stuff out, repeated myself. He’d say, ‘That’s really boring.’” I tell him how much I like the book. “Oh good, thank you, mate! All that pain and misery. I don’t know how you enjoy it, but people say they like it.” Perhaps enjoy is not quite the right word. It’s fascinating, painful and very funny against the odds. The coffee has had time to cool. “Simon, could you give me a hit of that coffee, would you mind? Sorry to ask you, mate.” I put the cup to his lips and he sucks from the straw. In the book, he says how angry Sachin gets with him because of his lack of pleases and thank yous. Today, his manners are impeccable. Kureishi says it was only when he came out of hospital that he realised how different he is now from most people. In hospital, pretty much everybody used a wheelchair. “When I finally got out on to the street and went up to Shepherd’s Bush [in west London], everyone was walking about, and you think, what the fuck, how can they walk? There are so many of them and there’s one wheelchair on the street. You have to get used to all that, and I have got used to it now.” He’s also getting used to the cost of life as a tetraplegic. “I have physio every day, which I pay for myself and is costing me a fucking fortune – nearly £100 a day, so money really matters. If I take a taxi into London to have supper and come back here, the taxi will cost me £200. Who the fuck has got that kind of money?” But he knows that among the unlucky, he’s one of the luckiest. “One guy rang me up and said, ‘I want to give you £25,000.’” What did you say to him? “‘Fuck me! For fuck’s sake.’ And he said, ‘No, I’m going to give it you. I know you’ve got terrible expenses, etc’ and he gave me the money.” Was he a close friend? “He was a friend, but not a close one. It was so moving and upsetting in a way.” Why upsetting? “That somebody would be so generous to me and see what a pickle I was in and what I needed.” Was it hard to accept? “I felt embarrassed. You don’t want to ask people for money. Ididn’task him for money. I would never ask for money. So I felt embarrassed, yeah. Suddenly you become a supplicant.” There are the friends who come round, bring food, feed him, brush his teeth, give him a head massage and read him a bedtime story. They spend hours with him. He’s humbled by their generosity and it’s made him question what kind of person he was before the accident. “It’s so beautiful that somebody’s doing this for me. Then you think, would I do this for someone else, and I think it wouldn’t occur to me. Most of the people who do all that for me are women, and you think, I wish I could do this for them now. But it’s too late for me to do this now, and I regret I didn’t do it before.” In Shattered, he writes, “I wish I had been kinder. If I get another chance I will be.” But he knows he won’t get the chance to help people in the way they have helped him. The selfishness of his former life is a recurring theme in Shattered. He’s not apologising for his past, just acknowledging it. He calls himself an “opportunist social climber” and says he loved hanging out with the older generation of British literary heavyweights – Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis, Julian Barnes. The mid-80s through to the 90s was a wonderful time for writers – advances were huge and plentiful. He might have been politically on the left, but he didn’t half benefit from the Thatcherite ethos. “In the 1980s, selfishness was the character ideal of the age, and fucking hell was it fun.” He makes no bones about being numero uno in his life. There was always a laddishness to Kureishi’s writing; a desire to prod and shock. In Shattered, he writes about his proneness to choking since the accident. “I am more intimate with the Heimlich manoeuvre than cunnilingus.” To even think of comparing the two takes a degree of perversity. He boasts about taking cocaine with his sons. After fantasising about “the world of filth and depravity”, he is reminded “how close sexuality and disgust have to be for sex to retain its edge”. Shattered is sex obsessed. But this time it’s not sex as a possibility or inevitability, it’s sex as an impossibility. The accident has left him impotent. I tell him he reminds me of Michael Gambon’s Philip Marlow in The Singing Detective, hospitalised, in psoriatic agony, but instead of trying to think of unsexy things to stifle an erection, here he’s conjuring up sexual fantasies to see if he’s capable of getting one. “Well, that’s a very perceptive thing to say. Iwaslying in bed like Michael Gambon in that show with these beautiful Italian nurses washing you and cleaning you, and you can’t feel anything. Your sexuality has gone for ever. They’re leaning over you, and they smell beautiful, and they’ve got great eyebrows, and all your dreams have come true. You’ve got three nurses tending to you, and there’snothingyou can do about it.” Kureishi is incorrigible. You sense he really does believe that if only he’d been in full working order, the nurses would have jumped into his hospital bed to enable him to fulfiltheirfantasies. In Shattered, to see if he can get himself going, he recalls a threesome he had in his promiscuous 40s after he had left his first wife. A younger woman he hooked up with in Amsterdam gets in touch to tell him she’s in Britain. He asks her to visit him. Would you like me to bring anything, she asks. Yes, he says – chocolate, weed, magic mushrooms and a friend. What strikes me about the passage, I tell Kureishi, is the way you depict yourself as a taker rather than a giver. He smiles. “Well, that night I was obviously looking for an adventure, but I wouldn’t say that was an everyday experience. I wrote about it because I thought it was funny.” It’s also bathetic. “It was a disappointment,” he admits. “I’d been expecting a threesome with two women and she turned up with her boyfriend who was the same age as me, clinically depressed and barely said anything. He just sat on the end of the bed with his head in his hands watching me fuck his girlfriend.” He launches into a spluttering phlegmy cough. It sounds so uncomfortable for him. “Excuse me,” he says when he gets his breath back. “Coughing is really important to clear your lungs, and I’ve got reduced capacity. It’s difficult for me to clear my lungs.” Kureishi tells me about Nietzsche’s theory of the eternal recurrence – the philosophical concept that our lives will repeat infinitely and in each life every detail will be exactly the same. He says he lay in his hospital bed, revisiting the past, asking himself whether he’d want to change it. “You can’t live a life without thinking how stupid you were and what a mistake that was, and how self-sabotaging that was. I’ve been in therapy for a long time, and my therapist kept me from some of my more self-destructive impulses to do with substances and bad relationships and stupid behaviour. And having kids has also kept me on the straight and narrow.” When he totted up his balance sheet, he concluded the one thing he wouldn’t change at all is his time with d’Amico. “She’s my destiny; the person I want to be with.” Did he ever think something awful could happen to disturb that contentment? “Yes. When I turned the TV off and went into the kitchen to close the windows at night, I used to look out and think, how much longer is this going to go on? There’ll be a day when this happiness will end. I always thought that way.” Shattered is as savage as anything he’s written, but it’s also in large part a love letter to all those who have supported him – friends; strangers on the street; his sons; d’Amico; Scoffield, who emerges as heroic. “When I go out on the street, people come up to me all the time and say, ‘Well done, mate, I love your writing.’ Nobody approached me before. Now it’s every day. I’ve become a local celebrity because of the blog.” In a way he wasn’t before? “It’s the disability. It’s pity. And it’s love. And it’s their generosity. You realise how kind people are. How loving they are.” He seems so astonished by the world’s kindness, I wonder if it’s because he himself used to have an unkind view of the world. Perhaps fans didn’t approach him because he seemed unapproachable – too cool for school. He doesn’t have time to answer before he is hit by another phlegmy coughing fit. “Excuse me,” he says. Time for a drink. Over the morning, we’ve developed a curious, and rather lovely, intimacy. As I stand over him, putting the straw to his lips, he tells me how much he misses being able to scratch his arse. I almost offer to do it for him. But there has been progress. Now he can scratch his face and eyes with his knuckles. It’s amazing how often you need to scratch yourself, he says, and when you have use of your hands you never think about it. “If you tied your hands up for a day and had to spend the day without their use, you’d see what they mean to you.” He takes another sip of water. “Cheers, Simon.

Shannoo spent his working life as a civil servant at the Pakistani embassy in London, but really wanted to be a writer. He wrote many unpublished novels. The depiction of him in The Buddha of Suburbia devastated Kureishi’s sister Yasmin, who wrote a letter to the Guardian saying he had sold his family “down the line” and she would not stand by and let it be “fabricated for the entertainment of the public or for Hanif’s profit”. She objected to his portrait of the family as working class and their father as a bitter old man. Did she have a point? “My dadwasposh. Really posh. My mum was working class. He came from a very wealthy and privileged family. An educated family. He wasn’t like a traditional immigrant who comes from a village and goes to work in Bradford. He came over to study law and he had 11 siblings and most of them were sent either to the US or the UK to study law or medicine.” Where did the family get the money from? “My grandfather was a doctor and a colonel in the British army and a big gambler. He was the highest promoted Indian in the army. They had servants and he had a big house.” As for his father, he can’t speak highly enough about him today. “He was a very friendly, charming guy. He was a beautiful man, a very sweet man.” Why is Kureishi so often described as being of Pakistani heritage rather than Indian? Simple, he says. He was brought up to think of himself as Pakistani. “My dad went to work in the Pakistan embassy. You can’t work in the Pakistan embassy and call yourself an Indian! So he called himself a Pakistani, even though he’d never been there.” The Buddha of Suburbia wasadapted for the stageby Kureishi and director Emma Rice earlier this year. He admits he felt uneasy when he watchedthe play. “I thought, for fuck’s sake, what have I done? That’s my mum, my dad, that’s our house, our street. I’ve put them on the stage and made them look like idiots. I’ve embarrassed myself and I’ve embarrassed them.” It feels like an apology of sorts. But suddenly he changes tone. “Then I thought, it’s a warm, moving story about race and growing up in England, about pop music, sex, leaving home. It’s not a simple story of Hanif’s put his dad on the stage and made him look like a fool.” So was Yasmin right to say it was unfair on the family? “I would say that’s my story; that’s my version of it, and you have your version of it and somebody else will have their version of it. In any family there would be a collision of utterances.” And now he goes full Kureishi. The regret of a couple of minutes ago has morphed into an audacious celebration of his generosity. “Growing up in Bromley[in south-east London] in the 70s was boring. Really fucking boring. It was always raining and cold. And you see the play and it’s really funny and lively. I’ve done them a fucking favour. I’ve really brightened it up. There’s a lot of music in it, people are in bands, having sex and being creative.” There is another potential “What have I done?” moment in Shattered. While it’s loving towards his father, it’s anything but to his mother. He describes her as “the most boring person I ever met”, adding that “liking other people was one thing she couldn’t bear”. Was it necessary to write that? “Well, me and my mum always had a beef,” he says. Is she still alive? “No, she died about four years ago. Tracey warned me about that. She said, ‘Don’t say that shit about your mum.’ But I believe it. She said, ‘I liked your mum, she was charming, she was funny, she was sweet.’ Well, I had various beefs with my mum over the years.” Such as? “She was depressed most of her life. She was very withdrawn.” He calls out to his care worker. “The coffee’s getting a bit cold, Camilla, d’you mind making some more, please?” It’s cruel to call her the most boring person you’ve met, I say. “She wouldn’t engage with you,” he protests. “Depressed people can’t. They don’t. It’s not really her fault.” I tell him I’m a depressive and I can engage perfectly well with people. He looks amazed. “How long have you been depressed?” Most of my life, I say. “You don’t seem depressed to me. You’ve got a good sense of humour. You’re up for a laugh.” Would he have said she was the most boring person in the world if she’d still been alive? “Yep.” How would she have reacted? “I think she would have been offended.” What does he think Yasmin will make of the book? “We’ve got a bit of a beef going on,” he says. What about? “God knows. She came to see me in hospital and there was a minor beef. I can’t even remember what it was about.” Has there always been beef? “Yeah.” Who’s normally responsible? “Well, as you can imagine she would say, ‘Oh, he wasn’t very friendly.’ And I’ll say she wasn’t very friendly.” He thinks at some point Sachin will give Yasmin a ring and tell her she and Kureishi should bury their pride and sort out their differences. I’m still thinking about his mother. What does he think it says about him that he felt he had to write about her in this way? “That writers have a splinter of ice in their heart, as Graham Greene says. When I’m teaching writing, a student tells me a juicy story and I say, ‘That’s great, write it down’ and they’ll say, ‘I can’t say that – if my mum read it, she’d hate me for it.’ And then you think, well, you’re not a fucking writer, are you?” Are the boys similar in character to him? “They’re very sweet. They’re really good boys, and they’re better children to me than I was to my parents.” He loves being a writer, he says – possibly more than ever. It might take his carers two and a half hours to get him ready for the day – breakfast, washing, turning him over, cleaning his catheter, administering suppositories, hoisting him up, dressing him – but when it’s 10am and he’s sitting in his wheelchair, ready to write, or ready to be helped to write, he feels alive again. “Finally when I’m up, I can become a writer. I can become a human being. I can talk to you, talk to people. And it’s a relief to come back out into the world.” He never thought he would. Kureishi says at times he believed it was pointless going on. But he was so dependent on others that he couldn’t even kill himself without their help. D’Amico, who has been working upstairs, walks in. Kureishi looks at her adoringly and apologetically. “We are just talking about how I ruined your life,” he says. She laughs. “Ah, how you ruined my life much before the accident? Ten years ago!” I quote a bit from Shattered where he writes, “Isabella is broken by the accident.” Is that how she sees it? “It’s a difficult question. I’m not precisely happy about the accident, but we are much more organised, we know more things, we are dealing with it pretty well on the whole. We still have a nice time. It’s an adjustment.” The worst time, both agree, is night. “Sometimes I wake up in the night,” d’Amico says. “In the night Hanif’s really pessimistic.” Kureishi’s eyes start to moisten as she talks. “Isabella sleeps upstairs and I have to sleep in the hospital bed. It’s horrible, I don’t want her to sleep alone, but you can’t get two people in that bed.” One positive, she says, is he’s more gregarious. “After his accident, Hanif is much more keen on seeing friends. He liked to see friends before, but we were also lazy. I used to travel a lot. He has become more social.” “I hate being alone,” he says. “It’s depressing.” D’Amico heads off upstairs to get on with her work. Were you crying when she was talking, I ask. “Yeah. Well, I don’t want to hear that she’s been hurt by this shit. And I don’t want to feel I’ve inflicted on her a life that she doesn’t want. That’s terrible, that you’ve done this thing to all these people around you. That they have to be devoted to you in a way they didn’t anticipate. You put a terrible strain on other people. So I’ve got to write and keep being productive myself.” Kureishi says writing the book has helped restore his confidence. And, he hopes, this is just the start. As well as the adaptation of The Buddha of Suburbia, he’s working on the follow-up to Shattered and a screenplay for a movie. What’s it about, I ask. He smiles. “It’s going to be about a bloke staying in Rome who falls on his head and breaks his neck, then wakes up in hospital and has to learn to live again.” He says he’s slowly adjusting to being a disabled person. Are there any pluses? Well, he’s learned more about the realities of life; perhaps he was too cocooned before. “Trauma can create opportunity. So you say to yourself, this terrible thing happened to me, but how am I going to adjust to it and what can I do to speak from it, as it were. So I’ve got a new energy for writing, despite the fact that my body is broken. I’m not going to give up.” The bit of movement that has returned to his hand has given him hope. “I’ve started having occupational therapy and am trying to learn how to write with a pen. I’m like a four-year-old. I can make gestures and movements.” His goal is to be able to write his name, one day. “Eventually I’ll be able to sign one of my own books again. That would be a big deal for me.” D’Amico bursts into the room with a sense of urgency. “I’ve been thinking about it. I’ve not been broken. I’ve definitely not been broken,” she says passionately. “I was never broken.” “Yeah,” Kureishi says quietly. “‘I never noticed he’s a vegetable.’” D’Amico raises her eyes. She’s heard it all before. “As I say to Hanif, fortunately he’s a talking vegetable.” Does he talk more than he used to? “No, no,” she says. “Never fucking shuts up,” Kureishi says with a defiant grin.

King Charles won’t stand in the way if ‘Australia wants to become a republic’,,"King Charles has said he will not stand in the way if Australia wishes to replace him as the country’s head of state, it has been reported. Ahead of his visit later this month, the king is said to be adopting an “anti-confrontational approach” to Australian republican campaigners, theDaily Mailreported. In response to the Australian Republican Movement’s (ARM) request for a meeting with the monarch, the king’s assistant private secretary is understood to have emphasised his “deep love and affection” for Australia. Nathan Ross reportedly told the anti-monarchists: “His majesty, as a constitutional monarch, acts on the advice of his ministers and whether Australia becomes a republic is, therefore, a matter for the Australian public to decide.” The ARM says it is “the peak body advocating on behalf of the Australian people for an Australian republic with an Australian as our head of state”. Australia held a referendum in 1999 on the issue of becoming a republic, in which 54.9% voted against. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has previously said “Australia should have an Australian as our head of state”, but recently indicated that a second referendum was not a priority. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “Like his mother before him, it has always been the case that his majesty the king feels that it is a matter for the Australian people.” Graham Smith, the head of the British campaign group Republic who is in Australia to protest against the monarchy during the king’s visit, said the main reaction to the trip had been one of “indifference and disinterest”.

Most people are barely aware of the visit and couldn’t care less. “I’m here to promote the UK campaign, to question how Charles can represent us and why he is making this very brief visit at great expense to Australian and British taxpayers. “I’m also here to say to Australians this isn’t an institution that deserves respect or deference, and that they shouldn’t believe for a moment that the UK is a nation of royalists. I’m hoping the visit will help influence the debate in both countries and highlight the irrelevance of the monarchy.” The visit will be the king’s most significant overseas tour since his cancer diagnosis and his first to Australia as its head of state.",Tom Ambrose,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-ambrose,,across-the-country,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/12/king-charles-wont-stand-in-way-if-australia-wants-to-become-republic
"More Australians being ‘priced out’ of homes by big rent hikes, advocates fear",,"Renters in Australian capital cities are on average spending nearly $15,000 more a year to rent a house since the start of the pandemic, analysis has revealed. Research from the advocacy organisation Everybody’s Home showed on average renters in capitals are paying $14,700 more annually to rent a house, and $9,600 more to rent a unit compared with 2020. Sydney and Perth have endured the steepest rent rises, with annual increases well above capital city averages for units ($10,452 and $14,508 respectively) and houses ($18,512 and $18,304). Adelaide and Brisbane unit rents are also above average. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Everybody’s Home analysed rental data from SQM Research to build its report. Maiy Azize, a spokesperson from Everybody’s Home, said“keeping a roof over their head” is the biggest cost-of-living expense for most people in Australia. “The steep rise in rents is pushing more people into severe housing stress and homelessness,” Azize said. “People are sacrificing the necessities to afford the rent, living in appalling unhealthy conditions because there’s nowhere else for them to go, and ditching important life decisions because of housing insecurity. “Australians are being priced out of the cities where they work, which can affect the liveability of our cities and the quality of essential services.” One Sydney renter, Willimena, 60, lives in a sharehouse in Eastwood with her son and two others. Their rent goes up every year. “It went from $690 [a week] to $730 to $750 to $800 and the last one was going to be $900 but I was able to get it down,” she said. They now pay $850 after arguing no repairs had been made on the property and that they are good tenants. She is on a carer payment and works 15 hours a week at a vet clinic. “I’m struggling to pay bills, on top of rent and groceries. There are no luxuries.” If they get another increase, she will have to move further out, likely into another sharehouse, making it harder to get to work. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The most recent data from CoreLogic showed rents have reached a record high, with the national average now $627 a week, an 8.5% increase between May 2023 and 2024. Azize said a shortfall of 640,000 social homes was putting extra pressure on the rental market and pushing people into homelessness. “That is set to rise to nearly 1 million in two decades. We need to end the shortfall and turn social housing into an option for more Australians – not just a safety net for those at the margins.” Everybody’s Home wants the government to make changes to negative gearing and the capital gains tax, Azize said. Recent analysis by Guardian Australia showedthose earning over $180,000 benefited from a quarter of all negative gearing kickbacks, lowering their collective tax bill by $1.3bn in 2021-22. “Poll after poll shows that most voters want action on these investor tax handouts because they’re unfair and pushing up the cost of housing for everyone. Our supporters are excited by reports that Labor is open to change,” Azize said.",Cait Kelly,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/cait-kelly,2024-10-12,across-the-country,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/more-australians-being-priced-out-of-homes-by-big-rent-hikes-advocates-fear
"‘If you want us to die, we need to know’: hundreds of thousands of Afghans are waiting for visas to Australia – and time is running out",,"Afghan Australian Sara* is sobbing as she speaks via video call fromIran, a bandage on her nose that she explains was caused by flying missile debris raining down on traffic. About a month ago, Sara and her husband, Fadi*, left their Adelaide home to help their Afghan family members who are in Iran illegally, in hiding and in danger after fleeing the Taliban after the fall of Kabul in 2021. Now, Israel iscontemplating retaliationfor Iran’srocket attacks, amid its escalating war with Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The Australian government has told citizensnot to travel to Iran. There are risks of missile strikes, terrorist attacks, kidnapping and a “high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest,” according to the Smartraveller website. But Sara, 54, felt she had to go to help her mum, Rosina*, who is in her 70s, and to check on her other relatives. There are 16 of them – three families with seven children under 16 years old. The youngest is just five and pops her head into the video call with a cheeky smile. Rosina is one of 230,000 Afghans awaiting a decision from the Australian government on a visa that would ensure her safe passage to our shores, away from the reign of the Taliban in the region. In August 2021, after western troops withdrew fromAfghanistan, the Nazar family desperately tried to get on one of the few evacuation flights. “We attempted multiple times after the withdrawal to attend the airport, the gate that we were trying so hard to get to is instilled in our hearts,” one of the men, Faraz*, says through a translator. “It’s called Abbey Gate, the gate we never reached. “The Taliban would come right near us, and start firing the AK-47. The kids were screaming and yelling. They beat us with the AK-47s, pushed the women around. The kids got trampled.” Other direct family members – locally engaged employees working for Australia – got out. But those left behind were targeted by the Taliban. “The Taliban assaulted us. Our house was raided and that was the final straw. We knew we were in danger … it felt like the end of the world on the streets,” Faraz says. The family fled to Iran, holding on to a promise from Australia that they would be protected by their 449 visas – a temporary evacuation visa that was extended – with visa holders assured they would be prioritised in Australia’s humanitarian and refugee intake. According to the latest statistics, more than 250,000 Afghans have applied to the department of foreign affairs for a visa. About 20,000 of applications have been granted. The government has allocated 26,500 dedicated visa places for Afghans under its offshore humanitarian program through to 2026 and at least 5,000 through the family stream. The Dfat website says it is processing applications as quickly as they can, but that there are limited places. “We expect it may take several years to finalise all of those received in 2021,” it says. “We expect it will take at least six years from date of receipt for processing to commence on those lodged in 2022, 2023 or 2024.” Priority is being given to groups including locally engaged employees (LEEs), 449 visa holders and their family members. Meanwhile, Rosina hasn’t been able to see a doctor for years, too fearful of the danger outside her front door. “I had to come,” Sara says. “They have been inside the house for two years. They can’t go out. The police are deporting people, beating them. They disappear. “I went to the Australian embassy to get some answers … but they didn’t open the door to us. They said to call or email.” Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The family members that made it to Australia have been calling and emailing for years and the advice to the family has remained the same: go to the embassy. Asked if she’ll try to get out now that an Israeli attack seems imminent, Sara says she can’t. “How can I leave my mum, my family here? They need me. They need me to buy them food.” The Greens immigration spokesperson, David Shoebridge, says the Australian government has “failed to live up to” its responsibility to Afghans “after the generation-long invasion of Afghanistan”. “The Iranian regime is brutal. People from Afghanistan in Iran right now are not safe,” he says, adding that the government should have learned from the situation in Pakistan with deportations and focus on getting people out of Iran. “It was clear that the regime there would persecute people fleeing from Afghanistan,” he says. “The government did not act, and now people are in a deeply dangerous situation.” The danger is from both the threat of attack and from the deportations. The Iranian and Pakistani governments are rounding up Afghans and sending them back to the country they fled. A Dfat spokesperson said the government “remains committed to assisting Afghans who supported Australia’s mission in Afghanistan”. “The government … is extending all available effort to finalising certifications and visa applications for Afghan LEEs. If a person is certified as an Afghan LEE, the Department of Home Affairs will prioritise the processing of their humanitarian visa application,” the spokesperson said. The home affairs website says the government policy is to also prioritise the immediate families of LEEs. “There were promises made, very reluctantly, but they were made,” Shabnam Safa, from the Australian Hazara Advocacy Network, says. “Australia was involved there for 20 years. “You can’t help but feel that the whole Afghanistan matter has been completely deprioritised.” “We know people cannot get bread from local bakeries. They can’t get groceries – there are official signs saying we will not sell anything to Afghan refugees here. Let alone having no access to education, or employment, and constantly living in fear of being deported back to the Taliban.” The Nazar family say they fear deportation and death. “If you want us to die, we need to know that’s our destiny. Once they find us we will be deported,” Faraz says. “We’re losing faith that we’re going to be rescued.” *Names have been changed",Tory Shepherd,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tory-shepherd,2024-10-12,across-the-country,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/if-you-want-us-to-die-we-need-to-know-hundreds-of-thousands-of-afghans-are-waiting-for-visas-to-australia-and-time-is-running-out
From drip pricing to countdown clocks: five ways Australians can be duped into paying more,,"The consumer watchdog issuing Coles and Woolworthsover allegations the major supermarkets misled customers by offering “illusory” discounts. While those claims are set to be tested in court, there are a slew of other practices retailers and service providers use to take advantage of shoppers, many of which don’t get caught by current consumer protections. Consumer advocates say Australia’s laws lag the US, UK and EU when it comes to unfair trade practices, which means shoppers have to be alert. Here are five practices to look out for. It’s the online equivalent of “do you want fries with that”? During an online purchase, retailers now regularly suggest extra products to complement a purchase. The sophistication of those systems is improving, with online furniture stores among those now using artificial intelligence to suggest add-ons that will tempt shoppers. Consumer advocates say automated add-ons – where items are added at checkout without a customer’s express consent, such as extended warranties on appliances or expedited delivery programs – cross the line. “That type of thing is quite underhanded and can catch people out,” says Choice’s deputy director of campaigns, Andy Kelly. “Extended warranties don’t provide much more than what the law already provides for anyway so you could be paying for something that you are not going to get a whole lot of value from.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email There have also been examples of add-ons that are designed to give consumers the impression they are getting a good deal that have resulted in prosecutions. Last year, Dell Australia was fined for making misleading representations about discounted prices for monitors that could be “bundled” with a computer purchase at the checkout. More than 5,300 monitors were sold to consumers with overstated discounts, which the company had to remedy after conceding it had misled customers. Many consumers have experienced the grim feeling of having a payment come out of their bank account for a subscription service they no longer use. According to Erin Turner, the chief executive of the Consumer Policy Research Centre, it’s good practice for companies to let subscribers know when a fee is about to be charged, along with instructions on how to cancel. “That’s what a respectful relationship looks like with your customers,” Turner says. “It’s not hoping that people don’t remember that you’re giving them a service. That is not a good business model.” Subscription traps are high on the list of consumer grievances, and the method of signing customers up to them can be murky. Some retailers add “free” subscriptions to an online basket, with auto-renew fees turned on, which can come back to haunt the consumer later on. Others make it tricky to cancel. Home improvement platform hipages, which connects trades people with customers, conceded last year it did not adequately disclose contract terms that allowed it to automatically renew subscriptions and charge an early termination fee for those looking to cancel. Some retailers and accommodation providers pressure shoppers into making premature buying decisions by using countdown clocks or notifications that other people are looking at an item the customer has their eye on. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion In reality, there’s a good chance another countdown sale is happening soon, and there’s probably plenty of that product or service to go around. “There’s a lot of dark patterns, manipulative design techniques used to create false urgency or scarcity,” Turner says. “They’re all designed to create this sense that you’re going to lose out if you don’t purchase quickly.” The usual test of authenticity is whether the sales tactic is alerting customers to a genuine offer or insight into selling conditions, or whether it’s just being used to create artificial time pressure. “Drip pricing” refers to extra fees and charges added during an online purchase that makes the cost much higher than the initial advertised price. This has traditionally been used in travel, food delivery, accommodation and ticketing industries and varies from annoying to misleading and illegal. It is such a big issue in the US, which refers to the additional costs as “junk fees”, that itprompted the White Houseto recently describe the charges as a means to “obscure true prices and dilute the forces of market competition that are the bedrock of the US economy”. Kelly says companies need to be upfront about the fees they are charging. “If they’re not telling you that there’s a booking fee at any point until you get to the very end, then it’s probably not OK,” he says. “You can get a shock right before you’re about to make your purchase, but there’s a danger you just go through with it because you’ve already spent so much time getting to that point.” If you’ve returned an item because you’ve changed your mind, a store credit might be an appropriate goodwill gesture by the retailer. But if there’s a significant problem with the product or service, customers should ask for their money back, Turner says. “If something’s gone wrong, if you didn’t get what you paid for, if it’s broken, if it doesn’t do what it’s meant to do, you should be able to get your money back – not a gift card, not a credit, not a promise,” Turner says. Qantas washeavily criticisedfor its use of Covid credits dating from the extensive cancellations and border closures that came during the early pandemic. After intense political and public scrutiny, it changed its policies to remove expiry dates on the use of credits and started offering customers refunds. Some companies prefer to give credits and gift cards rather than a refund because they know some consumers won’t get around to using them, while others will use them as part of a bigger purchase. “Quite often the first thing you’re offered won’t be what you’re owed under the law,” Turner says. “And it’s on you to then go back and say, ‘no, I want a refund’.”",Jonathan Barrett,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-barrett,,across-the-country,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/12/accc-suing-coles-woolworths-pricing-strategies-allegations

Last year, Dell Australia was fined for making misleading representations about discounted prices for monitors that could be “bundled” with a computer purchase at the checkout. More than 5,300 monitors were sold to consumers with overstated discounts, which the company had to remedy after conceding it had misled customers. Many consumers have experienced the grim feeling of having a payment come out of their bank account for a subscription service they no longer use. According to Erin Turner, the chief executive of the Consumer Policy Research Centre, it’s good practice for companies to let subscribers know when a fee is about to be charged, along with instructions on how to cancel. “That’s what a respectful relationship looks like with your customers,” Turner says. “It’s not hoping that people don’t remember that you’re giving them a service. That is not a good business model.” Subscription traps are high on the list of consumer grievances, and the method of signing customers up to them can be murky. Some retailers add “free” subscriptions to an online basket, with auto-renew fees turned on, which can come back to haunt the consumer later on. Others make it tricky to cancel. Home improvement platform hipages, which connects trades people with customers, conceded last year it did not adequately disclose contract terms that allowed it to automatically renew subscriptions and charge an early termination fee for those looking to cancel. Some retailers and accommodation providers pressure shoppers into making premature buying decisions by using countdown clocks or notifications that other people are looking at an item the customer has their eye on. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion In reality, there’s a good chance another countdown sale is happening soon, and there’s probably plenty of that product or service to go around. “There’s a lot of dark patterns, manipulative design techniques used to create false urgency or scarcity,” Turner says. “They’re all designed to create this sense that you’re going to lose out if you don’t purchase quickly.” The usual test of authenticity is whether the sales tactic is alerting customers to a genuine offer or insight into selling conditions, or whether it’s just being used to create artificial time pressure. “Drip pricing” refers to extra fees and charges added during an online purchase that makes the cost much higher than the initial advertised price. This has traditionally been used in travel, food delivery, accommodation and ticketing industries and varies from annoying to misleading and illegal. It is such a big issue in the US, which refers to the additional costs as “junk fees”, that itprompted the White Houseto recently describe the charges as a means to “obscure true prices and dilute the forces of market competition that are the bedrock of the US economy”. Kelly says companies need to be upfront about the fees they are charging. “If they’re not telling you that there’s a booking fee at any point until you get to the very end, then it’s probably not OK,” he says. “You can get a shock right before you’re about to make your purchase, but there’s a danger you just go through with it because you’ve already spent so much time getting to that point.” If you’ve returned an item because you’ve changed your mind, a store credit might be an appropriate goodwill gesture by the retailer. But if there’s a significant problem with the product or service, customers should ask for their money back, Turner says. “If something’s gone wrong, if you didn’t get what you paid for, if it’s broken, if it doesn’t do what it’s meant to do, you should be able to get your money back – not a gift card, not a credit, not a promise,” Turner says. Qantas washeavily criticisedfor its use of Covid credits dating from the extensive cancellations and border closures that came during the early pandemic. After intense political and public scrutiny, it changed its policies to remove expiry dates on the use of credits and started offering customers refunds. Some companies prefer to give credits and gift cards rather than a refund because they know some consumers won’t get around to using them, while others will use them as part of a bigger purchase. “Quite often the first thing you’re offered won’t be what you’re owed under the law,” Turner says. “And it’s on you to then go back and say, ‘no, I want a refund’.”",Jonathan Barrett,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-barrett,,across-the-country,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/12/accc-suing-coles-woolworths-pricing-strategies-allegations

Dome of sweltering NT heat set to spread across vast swathes of Australia,,"Much of Australia’s south will likely bask in temperatures up to 8C hotter than normal next week, which could trigger an increased risk of thunderstorms over wide areas. A dome of heat that has put parts of the Northern Territory under heatwave warnings is set to spread east and west in the coming days, before moving south by the middle of next week, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Parts of the Top End around Darwin have sweltered under a heatwave for much of the last two weeks, with temperatures up to 5C above normal and hitting 41C. The bureau’s official heatwave warning is likely to stay in place for a few more days, and the heat is expected to spread into Western Australia’s Kimberley and east over the Cape York peninsula in the early part of the week. Angus Hines, senior meteorologist at the bureau, said on Saturday: “Some of that heat from the north-west will be spreading into central Australia. It’s going to be a gradual build as that heat moves over the course of a few days starting from today.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email By Wednesday or Thursday, Hines said forecast models showed temperatures 4C to 8C above average stretching from the centre of WA to the New South Wales coast. “Most of the country will be seeing above average temperatures,” he said. The early part of the week would also carry the risk of thunderstorms across large areas of the south and east. “We will see the humidity climb and that combination of warmth and humidity could feed thunderstorm developments across eastern states,” Hines said. “It’s a messy map with broad areas that could be hit and miss [for storms]. It’s hard to pinpoint the detail … but there’s multiple areas for thunderstorm activity from Monday to Wednesday.” Hines said the area of likely thunderstorm development was across NSW, Victoria, southern Queensland and northern Tasmania.

"After 23 years of Labor, independents could be kingmaker in tense ACT election battle",,"TheAustralian Capital Territorypoll to be held on Saturday 19 October has the vibe of a change election. With Labor governing for 23 years and Andrew Barr the chief minister for a decade, there is a sense that something has to give. “We’re looking, I think, for a change, but it has to be a good change and we don’t know if that’s on offer at the moment,” says Jean Gifford, aCanberraresident who this week attended an event called “politics at the pub” to hear from independent candidates. “We don’t really want someone who is going to be totally against our values,” she says, citing religion interfering withvoluntary assisted dyingas a concern. The ACT has a reputation as Australia’s most progressive jurisdiction due to policies such as VAD, which requireda change in federal law by the Albanese government,drug decriminalisationand100% renewable energy. For many progressive voters this tension sits at the centre of the campaign: how to push the ACT government to go further but avoid an “it’s time” effect unwinding existing wins. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads For swing voters, an election at the height of a cost-of-living squeeze could see them abandon Labor for the Liberal opposition. At the 2020 election the Liberals won nine seats in the 25-member parliament, with Labor (10) and the Greens (six seats, a record result) combining to form a coalition government, their third in a row in a parliament that nearly always produces minority governments. The ACT Liberals’ campaign warns voters of the prospect of a forever government, asking: if not now, when? A few seats shifting from the left parties to the right could be enough for Liberal Elizabeth Lee to form government. The independents, the main group of which intend to sit on the crossbench rather than join government, could, if elected, reinstall Barr or hand government to Lee. Barr says Labor offers a “balance of experience and new members”, pitching his government as one that changes over time despite two decades in power. “I don’t apologise for Labor having been successful at previous elections – but each government is different. There is no one in the current parliamentaryLabor partywho was part of the first government.” The Greens leader, Shane Rattenbury, the minister for climate change and justice, is pitching change from within: if enough progressives switch their votes, the Greens could be the lead partner in government, he argues. Rattenbury is hoping to outflank the government of which he is a member on its left. “Certainly we think there does need to be change,” he declares, with voters looking for answers on the cost of living, the housing crisis and climate emergency. “I think what they see from the Labor party is lack of ambition on these issues. They see a party that is comfortable, that is business as usual, with some tweaking around the edges.” The Greens have “a higher level of ambition” with policy differences such as a ban on gambling ads, accelerating the rollout of the light rail and for the government tobuild and buy10,000 new public homes over the next 10 years. Barr says there is “not the workforce, the budget or the borrowing” capacity to deliver on that promise, which Rattenbury should know because “he is on the expenditure review committee”. Rattenbury counters that the policy has been costed independently, although itdoes not yet appearin the treasury’s costing of election promises. Barr says on top of the ACT’s existing 200,000 dwellings, Labor is committed to deliver “another 30,000 homes, 5,000 a year … [which] would exceed our share of the national housing agreement”. The Liberals are promising accelerated land release for 6,050 plots, claiming this can deliver $1bn more revenue in the first term of government, but Lee says the party is still working through this costing with treasury. In the longer term, the Liberals propose 100,000 homes by 2050 on the ACT’s eastern fringe by demolishing a pine plantation at Kowen forest, a policy which unites Labor and the Greens. While Rattenbury pitches change from within, the Independents for Canberra grouping wants to shake things up from outside the tent. Its leader, Thomas Emerson, describes the government as complacent. “They’ve been in power for 23 years, it’s not much of an incentive to push things forward at a fast rate. So people are frustrated at a lack of action.” The Independents for Canberra intend to sit on the crossbench, meaning they could offer confidence and supply to a major party to govern but will not be taking seats in cabinet. The group won’t declare before the election who they would make chief minister if any of their candidates are elected, which Barr says is “not being upfront with voters”. Emerson counters that the Greens guaranteeing support for Labor has failed to deliver. “We’ve been told we’ve had a progressive government for a long time, but we have the second worst dwelling condition in our public housing stock … the highest rates of persistent homelessness in Australia, the highest rates of reoffending … In a whole range of key progressive areas we’ve been failing.” Sign up toFive Great Reads Each week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Saturday morning after newsletter promotion The Independents for Canberra have issued a “statement of expectations” which includes “no backward steps on climate action, voluntary-assisted dying or abortion access”. Emerson says “we have seen some concerning signs from parts of the Liberal party with respect to treatment of people based on race, sexuality and so on”. Barr puts it more bluntly: that the“Liberal party is endemically rightwing and conservative”, arguing this is a tendency Lee cannot suppress. He notes that Lee“expelled one of her sitting members on the eve of the election” –Elizabeth Kikkert– and has a “range of colleagues and candidates who hold quite extreme views”, a reference in part to theshadow attorney general, Peter Cain, who apologisedfor a 2002 workbook he wrote which painted a rosy picture of how Christian settlers helped First Nations peoples. Lee rejects Barr’s charge as a “politically lazy” and “predictable” fear campaign which “belongs in student politics”. And can she guarantee no backward steps on climate, VAD and abortion? “Yes,” she answers in a single word. Lee says the Liberals are a “very diverse” group and represent“the diversity of views we see across the community” but under her leadership the party is focused on the “issues Canberrans tell us are important for them”. The opposition’s pitch is that it is focused on value-for-money in government services, not culture wars, in short. The Liberals are running primarily on cost of living, by capping rate increases to 2.2%, which Lee says is a “stark contrast” to the way Canberrans have been “gouged” by increases of 6-9% on average for more than a decade. In Tuesday evening’s rapid-fire leaders debate at the National Press Club, Barr accused Lee of “magic pudding” economics in part because the promise of a rate cap, with households $2,000 better off on average, has not been costed. Lee responds that after 13 budgets as treasurer, Barr is yet to deliver a surplus, urging him to “look in the mirror”. Lee says the Liberal party is “working through the treasury process” to have it costed, and notes ACT Labor is yet to submit its policy for 800 more healthcare workers. The ACT’s electoral system seesfive electorateseach elect five members of the Legislative Assembly through proportional representation. It’s a similar voting system to the federal Senate, with an extra twist that on the ballot the candidates’ names appear in a different order within each column. A quirk of the election is that so many of the party leaders – Barr, Lee, Rattenbury and Emerson – are contesting the central electorate of Kurrajong. The election will likely be decided by who wins the fifth and final seat in Yerrabi (centred on the northern suburb of Gungahlin), Ginninderra (the western suburb of Belconnen), Murrumbidgee (the inner south-west, and Woden) and Brindabella (the far south, Tuggeranong). That could see the balance of power come down to people like Fiona Carrick, another independent who won 7.7% in Murrumbidgee last time, or the conservative Belco party, which won 9.4% in Ginninderra. Lee says Canberrans “certainly do” think it’s time for a new government, claiming “self-confessed, life-long Labor voters” have told her they’re voting Liberal this time due to Labor’s “mismanagement, waste and poor decisions”. “If the Canberra Liberals are in a position to be able to form minority government, then the result will be that the Canberra community has clearly voted for a change … and I would ask that the independents take that very seriously.” Barr says Lee is offering “nothing particularly fresh”, suggesting her policies are an amalgam of three previous Liberal leaders he has seen off. It’s unclear what verdict Canberrans will deliver at the polls, but it’s noteworthy that even the incumbents are pitching themselves as the safer bet for renewal.",Paul Karp,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-karp,,across-the-country,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/12/act-election-labor-independents-polls
Victoria police officer suspended over alleged Nazi salutes and ‘Heil Hitler’ comments,,"TheVictoriapolice chief commissioner has apologised to the Jewish community after a veteran sergeant allegedly performed a Nazi salute to colleagues at the police academy twice this week. The 65-year-old woman was suspended with pay on Friday evening while police launched a criminal investigation into the alleged incidents, which included her allegedly saying “Heil Hitler” on both occasions, Shane Patton said. The woman has been in the police force for 40 years and was recently posted in the people development command training centre, Patton said. On Tuesday the sergeant allegedly approached two employees, performed the Nazi salute and said “Heil Hitler”, Patton said. The sergeant allegedly again used the salute and phrase on Wednesday while at a debrief with a recruit squad and an instructor. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The sergeant was interviewed on Saturday by professional standards command detectives. She was released without charge at this stage, police said in a statement. The investigation is ongoing. A brief of evidence will be prepared, with the woman expected to be charged on summons, police said. If charged, the sergeant faces a potential 12-month imprisonment or $23,000 fine. Patton said members found guilty of similar conduct face “a very strong chance of being dismissed”. The people development command, where the suspended sergeant worked, “develops the skills, capability, and confidence of Victoria police members by providing training to sworn members from recruits through to executive leaders”, according to a 2022 report from the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner. Patton said he was appalled by the alleged incidents. He said, to his knowledge, the woman had “no history of extreme views”. “It’s abhorrent conduct and it doesn’t matter who commits it – we will investigate it and we will investigate it thoroughly.” He acknowledged the alleged incidents occurred at “a time of profound sadness”. “This occurs in a week where we saw people around the world coming together in solidarity to support the Jewish community, the Jewish people, when we’re one year after the worst loss of life they have had since the Holocaust,” Patton said. “This will only exacerbate that grief and pain they’re feeling. There’s simply no place for this type of conduct in our society, let alone in this police force. “For that reason, I want to profoundly apologise to the Jewish community, but also the community as a whole. They will undoubtedly be feeling let down that this conduct has occurred by a police officer.” Patton said “there is no suggestion” the alleged incidents related to the7 October anniversary.

Half of Australia’s law enforcement agencies have banned officers using encrypted messaging apps,,"Half of the Australian law enforcement agencies across Australia have banned their officers from using messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal, after New South Wales police last week banned the practice. Last week, theNSW police force saidit had introduced security software that meant “social media and other personal apps will not work or be downloadable” on NSW police force issued devices. It was reported that about 17,000 officers had been ordered to remove communications apps from their devices. A Law Enforcement Conduct Commission report arising out of an investigation into claims of a police cover-up over an officer’s car crash in 2023 found some officers had adopted the practice of deleting messages, and records of messages and calls from encrypted communication apps. While Victoria, Queensland and South Australia had joined NSW in banning the use of communication apps, the Australian federal police permitted use, while Tasmania and South Australia had no strict bans. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email A spokesperson for the AFP confirmed a “limited number of communications applications” were approved for use by officers. “These have been security vetted and are regularly reviewed. For operational reasons the AFP will not disclose what those applications are.” A spokesperson for SA police it doesn’t permit the use of private or work-issued devices for sharing information that could be an official police record. “Any information that is an official police record is captured on SAPOL information systems that have appropriate storage and comply with legislation.” A Victoria police spokesperson said due to security and accountability concerns that “operational Victoria police members are not sanctioned to use WhatsApp or Signal – or indeed any third-party messaging apps – for official duties”. The spokesperson said it was crucial in maintaining public confidence in the ability for the police to collect and manage information effectively and in line with legal obligations. A spokesperson for Queensland police said members are not allowed to use private email accounts or messaging applications like WhatsApp for duties “as the use of such accounts poses a security risk and prevents the proper management of records.” The Queensland police service (QPS) has substantial information holdings and takes record management and privacy seriously, the spokesperson said. “Breaches of QPS policy and procedures are subject to a robust internal investigation process.” The spokesperson said there are limited and exceptional times when social media services can be used to assist with investigations, particularly when it comes to online offending. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion A WA police spokesperson said there were no bans in place, but use of technology is subject to “strict protocols” including around security of the apps and information records requirements. Tasmania police did not ban the apps, but also did not sanction the use, a spokesperson said. NT police did not respond by deadline. For the AFP, communications via messaging apps are subject to freedom of information law, however, there have beenseveral caseswhere attempts to gain access to messages that were allegedly communicated on auto-delete messaging apps were denied. The National Archives has said messages on apps as part of government business are commonwealth records, and should be retained, however, the office of the Australian information commissioner has no powers to sanction agencies where records have not been retained. The ban by some police forces on encrypted apps comes amid a long running push from law enforcement and security agencies for tech companies to make access to encrypted communications apps easier for policing purposes . The AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, told the National Press Club in April that law enforcement agencies had pleaded with social media companiesto not shift to end-to-end encryption for communicationsuntil it protects against online crime. “We recognise the role that technologies like end-to-end encryption play in protecting personal data, privacy and cybersecurity, but there is no absolute right to privacy,” he said. An unnamed officer reportedly told the Daily Telegraph that the ban would mean officers would instead switch to “burner” phones to allow them to continue to use the apps on non-work devices.

Some Australian states are discovering what happens when they have too much rooftop solar,,"When Victoria basks in mostly sunny spring weather this weekend, energy authorities will be monitoring how far electricity demand ebbs. If needed, they’ll turn off rooftop solar systems to ensure stability for the grid. Such minimum system load events, as they are called, have emerged as a new challenge as households across Australia take advantage of plunging prices for solar panels to shield themselves from rising power bills and cut carbon emissions. The AustralianEnergyMarket Operator issued two such alerts for Victoria during the AFL grand final weekend a fortnight ago, and warned of two for this Saturday and Sunday. Prior to this cluster, the state’s only previous warning was last 31 December. The public has become inured to annual alerts to possiblepower shortfalls during summer heatwavesor extendedcold snaps during winter. It won’t be long before the obverse – a grid strained by too little demand – is common during mild, sunny spring and autumn days, when the need for cooling or heating abates, experts say. “It’s all going to be uncomfortably interesting for energy system people,” said Tennant Reed, director of climate change and energy at the Ai Group, noting there are “emerging rules to keep the show on the road”. Having a grid that is supplied entirely by renewable energy is something Aemo and state and federal governments have anticipated as they step up support for so-calledconsumer energy resources. Australian households have already embraced rooftop solar at a pace unmatched anywhere, with more than a third generating power at home. Many options are available to source extra demand, such as encouraging people to use more of their generation at peak sunny periods, renewable advocates say. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Hot water heaters, now often operating at night, could be switched on during the day, while certain industrial users could be given incentives to increase production, much like they are now rewarded to power down during summer heatwaves. Still, the looming challenges aren’t small, particularly as coal-fired power plants shut. The grid’s system strength is “projected to decline sharply over the next decade”, Aemo said in its latest 2024Electricity Statement of Opportunitiesreport. From October to December is likely to be when demand sinks to its lowest for most parts of the national electricity market. (The national electricity market or Nem serves all regions except Western Australia and the Northern Territory.) Windy, sunny spring days – much like the coming weekend in Victoria – also mean an elevated supply of renewable energy in a season of minimal heating or cooling need. A year ago, on 29 October, Nem grid demand hit a record minimum of about 11 gigawatts for 30 minutes. Small-scale solar, most of it on residential roofs, met 52% of underlying demand. As more homes install solar, the Nem’s minimum demand may continue to shrink at the present rate of 1.2GW each year, Aemo said. The Nem needs at least 4.3GW of electricity moving across its transmission network. If there are “unplanned network or unit outages”, the threshold rises to about 7GW – a level that may be breached as soon as next spring, Aemo said. “While these periods of very high distributed PV levels relative to underlying demand are currently not frequent, they will increase over time and could occur during unusual events and outage conditions,” it said. “A credible disturbance could lead to reliance on emergency frequency control schemes which are known to be compromised in such low operational demand periods, escalating risks of system collapse and blackouts.” However, the market has a sizeable toolkit to address those risks. South Australia, where about half the homes have solar panels, already has coped with two minimum system load events of level 3 – the most serious – on 11 October 2020 and 14 March 2021. For the latter, SA Power Networks, a company part-owned by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Cheung Kong Infrastructure, was ordered to turn off 71 megawatts of photovoltaic systems. It was the first such intervention by Aemo. So-called solar curtailment is now a feature of SA’s operating system even if such an intervention is meant to be a “last resort”,the network group said. Before such action, large-scale solar and wind farms will be turned off, as will big solar systems on shopping centres and factories. Exports of surplus solar power from homes will also be halted before the systems themselves are turned off. According to WattClarity, a leading energy data website, SA had at least eight such rooftop solar curtailments in 2022 and 2o23. Victoria, which introduced similar “backstop” rules on 1 October this year, says consumers can do their bit. Solar curtailment should be authorities’ last move. “We encourage households with solar panels to make the most of their clean energy and save on bills by using their solar power during the day – whether it’s charging electric vehicles, doing laundry or running dishwashers,” a Victorian government spokesperson said. For Victoria, the backstop mechanism won’t affect a household’s ability to consume their own solar generation. Large batteries are part of the toolkit from this spring, with storage on standby to create additional demand by charging up. New South Wales and Queensland are expected to face similar challenges in coming years. NSW, though, is yet to start public consultation on restrictions of solar exports, with minimum load issues not forecast until late 2025 or beyond. Wayne Smith, the acting CEO of Smart Energy Council, said the best way to solve the issue would be to encourage more adoption of home batteries, not restraining rooftop solar. (About one in five new solar system includes a battery, consultancy SunWiz says.) “The abundance of rooftop solar is a gift from Australian households who’ve forked out their own money to produce energy from their own homes,” Smith said. “Too often, governments and regulators see solar as a problem that needs to be managed, rather than an opportunity that should be harnessed.” Peter Hannam is Guardian Australia’s economics correspondent",Peter Hannam,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peter-hannam,,across-the-country,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/12/australian-states-too-much-rooftop-solar

Most lack insulation and guttering. At Drive-in Camp outside town, the homes are tin sheds, disconnected from services since the 2007 intervention but still occupied. The poor housing is making the residents sick, Jupurrurla says: “I worry about the future – will my grandchildren and their kids be living in prison-like houses? Or are we going to start designing homes that allow us to practise our culture?” A $1bn investment in remote housing in the NT since 2017 has failed to solve the problem. A further $4bn was pledged in March in a joint announcement by the federal and Territory governments. But health experts warn that unless authorities commit to a dramatic shift in the way housing is designed and built for Indigenous communities, public health outcomes could worsen. Poor housing has been blamed for high rates of rheumatic heart disease in the NT. The preventable condition is caused by repeated, untreated streptococcus A infections and is linked to poverty, overcrowded and inadequate housing and lack of access to healthcare. Australia has one of the highest rates of RHD in the world, and rates have doubled between 2012 and 2021. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Jupurrurla says community participation in decision-making leads to better maintenance and a sense of ownership. He is the chair of Wilya Janta, a cultural consultancy and housing collective based in Tennant Creek which has developed housing designs by Aboriginal people for Aboriginal people. “For too long, we’ve been given houses we had no say in designing,” he says. Simon Quilty, a GP based in Tennant Creek, also works with Wilya Janta. He says nothing symbolises the failure of government housing design more clearly than steel trapdoors. These were introduced about five years ago to accommodate future air conditioning installations. But instead of providing relief from the heat they act as conductors, turning homes into ovens. “If you can’t afford an aircon, then you’ll have a heat-conducting steel plate making you need that aircon even more than if you did have the money to buy one,” Quilty says. “It is madness, these design lunacies make houses more expensive to build and injure the wellbeing of the resident for no possible gain, to save a few measly bucks.” Glenn Platt, the executive director of strategy and innovation at Emergent Group, says the metal trapdoor is like “having an extra glass window in the room”. The result is a home which is hotter inside than out, a significant health risk when temperatures are frequently above 40C. Overcrowded and poorly ventilated housing is a major driver of preventable diseases among Aboriginal communities, with more than half of all Indigenous people in the NT living in overcrowded homes. Dr John Paterson, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT, says poor housing contributes to the spread of infectious diseases, hampers early childhood development, affects mental health, and diminishes social and emotional wellbeing. “Diseases like rheumatic heart disease are better termed diseases of poverty; driven by overcrowded housing, lack of access to washing facilities and palatable drinking water that is unfortunately too common in remote communities, particularly in the central region,” he says. Overcrowded environments increase the chances of repeated exposure to streptococcus bacteria. While harmless on the skin’s surface or easily managed by antibiotics in communities with good access to health services, repeat infections can lead to immune reactions that scar heart valves. “We’re asking for the same basic human rights which include the same building standards, the same building repair and maintenance expectations, the same basic functions of a house – like access to suitable drinking water and a continuous power supply – that people living in any other jurisdiction in Australia take for granted,” Paterson says. “But for too long these standards have not been met in remote communities.” Most government-built homes in remote areas are built using concrete blocks. They have inadequate thermal efficiency, poor ventilation and minimal climate control. The new housing funding will pay for up to 2,700 new three-bedroom homes over 10 years. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese,said the program was designed to halve overcrowding in Indigenous communities in the NTas part of the Closing the Gap goals. Some 971 new or replacement homes have been built and 489 expanded under other funding deals since 2017. A federal Department ofHousingspokesperson said the new builds would be constructed after consultation with Indigenous communities and Aboriginal Housing NT. Skye Thompson, AHNT’s chief executive, told Guardian Australia that the new homes must be appropriate for the climate and culture of those living in them. “When houses are built to a lower standard of energy efficiency and works are not subject to a proper certification process; when they are poorly oriented, too hot or stuffy; and when the design doesn’t suit the residents’ family configuration or culture, the return on investment nosedives,” she says. The NT minister for housing construction, Bill Yan, said the new Country Liberal party government, whichswept to victory in Auguston a platform that included reversing youth justice reforms andlowering the age of criminal responsibility to 10, reaffirmed the NT government’s commitment to the $4bn housing partnership with the federal government. “The partnership with the federal government is a signed agreement that the new government will honour,” he said. “Territorians living in safe housing is an important part to community safety as well as enjoying our Territory lifestyle,. “We will listen to stakeholders and communities on their housing needs and consider expert advice on any issues prohibiting effective and efficient delivery of remote housing.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter",Otis Filley,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/otis-filley,2024-10-12,the-rural-network,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/could-aboriginal-designed-housing-help-solve-the-health-crisis-in-remote-communities
Tanya Plibersek defends Aboriginal heritage order blocking ‘irreversible damage’ of goldmine tailings dam,,"Tanya Plibersek has defended herdecision to issue an Aboriginal heritage protection orderfor the site of a proposed goldmine near Blayney, saying the financial impact on the mining company does not outweigh “irreversible damage and permanent loss” to Aboriginal cultural heritage sites. The environment minister made a partial declaration under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act in August, blocking a proposal by mining company Regis Resources to build a tailings dam for its $900m McPhillamys gold project in the headwaters of the Belubula River. The declaration did not cover the rest of the proposed mining area. Regis said at the time that the decision “made the project in its current form unviable”. In a 22-page statement on Friday, Plibersek said she noted that Regis had considered 30 alternative sites for a tailings dam, but recognised that the protection order would make the mine “unviable in the state in which it is currently proposed and approved”. “However, having considered all the submissions and material available to me in relation to the proprietary and pecuniary impacts of the making of a declaration over the specified area, I was satisfied that the proprietary and pecuniary impacts to the proponent and others do not outweigh the irreversible damage and permanent loss to the Aboriginal cultural heritage in the declared area,” she wrote. “The long-term effect on cultural heritage is permanent, and the loss of cultural heritage cannot be mitigated or reversed.” Regis Resources declined to comment further on Friday. The cultural heritage protection was welcomed by some traditional owners, locals and farmers. However, it was criticised by the mining industry, business groups and the mayor of the local council, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton,said he would overturn itif the Coalition won government next year. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter The decision was also criticised by theNew South WalesAboriginal Land Council (NSWALC), which said it was concerned that Aboriginal cultural heritage had been used “as a pawn for political posturing and advantage”. NSWALC represents the Orange Local Aboriginal Land Council (OLALC). The section 10 application was made by Wiradyuri elder Aunty Nyree Reynolds, who is represented by the Bathurst-based Wiradyuri Traditional Owners Central West Aboriginal Corporation (WTOCWAC). Both groups represent Wiradyuri peoples. Plibersek found that the Belubula River, headwaters and springs were “of particular significance to Wiradjuri people” and that the proposed construction of the tailings dam, which would involve plugging the springs with concrete, was “inconsistent with the treatment of waterways within Aboriginal tradition and pose a threat of injury or desecration to the area”. “Irreversible damage to the Belubula River headwaters would remain, despite proposed restoration of the mine site,” she said. Plibersek said even Regis’s conceptual drawings of the area post-rehabilitation showed the river to be “significantly modified”. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “Development of the [tailings storage facility] would involve plugging the springs with cement and the TSF may cause water pollution, which would not only threaten water quality in the Lachlan-Murray basin, but will sever Wiradjuri connection to the specific area,” she said. She also found that state heritage laws would not offer sufficient protection, citing a letter from the NSW environment minister, Penny Sharpe, who said intangible cultural heritage values were “not currently protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 unless an Aboriginal place is gazetted”, which this proposed site was not. Those laws also do not apply to approved state significant developments. The basis of the protection declaration was a claim that the Belubula River, headwaters and springs were the site of pre-initiation ceremonies in Wiradyuri culture and that the river itself was the subject of the Blue Banded Bee dreaming. Another area, the Dungeon Burial site, was found to be a significant Aboriginal site but not at risk from the proposed mine. The OLALC said it had no evidence or knowledge of the use of the area for ceremonial purposes. It also provided a statement from six people, including five Wiradyuri people, disputing the existence of any dreaming or creation story relating to the Blue Banded Bee. But Plibersek said WTOCWAC was “an established group of accepted community elders” and she was “satisfied that WTOCWAC had demonstrated that the individuals who provided the statements hold knowledge of traditions, customs and beliefs relating to the specified area”. She cited Dinawan Dyirribang Uncle Bill Allen, a senior Wiradyuri elder and descendent of the Wiradyuri warrior Windradyne, who said the area was “like a big university for our young fellas to come to get their learning”. She wrote that she understood that both the OLALC and Regis disputed that the area was used for ceremonial purposes but said she was “satisfied that this lack of knowledge is consistent with Aboriginal tradition that not all people are aware of the location of such ceremonies, particularly where those ceremonies pertain to men’s or women’s business”. On the Blue Banded Bee dreaming, she said OLALC’s comments were “consistent with WTOCWAC’s submission that the dreaming is knowledge that is only passed to specific custodians in accordance with Aboriginal oral tradition”. She added that the elder responsible for the story was in hospital at the time the initial section 10 report was compiled.

"Good coffee, breweries and dog washes: what makes a regional Australian town attractive to treechangers?",,"There’s a pub near me in a town of a few hundred people. The building was more than a century old, the verandas were sagging and the patrons were sparse. Two women saw its potential and took the surrounding country residents seriously enough to offer a good dining experience for a handsome price, confident we would pay for a decent meal in a beautifully restored building. It worked. Every town has a similar story. The pub restoration didn’t happen in a vacuum. It was next door to a great cafe that already drew people in, as well as a greengrocer and a wine shop. With the pub, critical mass was bedded down in a village of 300. Together, these businesses create a gentrified precinct. You might know similar places, little pockets of caffeine-charged retail energy, that change the spending habits of locals and attract newcomers, some of whom move to the district permanently on the strength of the introduction. It is hard to nail down what constitutes gentrification. Certainly, fancy pubs and strong coffee are staple businesses. More than half of Australia’scraft breweriesand distilleries are now in regional Australia. Dog groomers may be associated with pampered inner-city pooches but they’re a dime a dozen in most country towns now. While those local businesses are responding to the demands of existing residents, they have become important markers for the kind of towns that have attracted treechangers. Surveying the regional landscape since the great regional migration in the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s not too much of a stretch to declare the country has developed its own kind of cool. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Over the past year, two studies (bythe Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (Ahuri)andthe iMOVE Cooperative Research Centre) reveal that it was important to a portion of treechangers that their new community have an urban feel. Also important was proximity to the coast, a larger population centre and, most importantly, a job. The independent economist Kim Houghton said the recent research showed that while regional migration trends were changing, 73% of people in capital city households remained interested in moving to a regional city, compared to just 57% of people in regional households being interested in moving to a capital city. It’s the urban nature of a place like Ballarat in central Victoria that is an important attractor for people who cannot afford to live closer to the action in Melbourne. A bit of Brunswick in Ballarat, if you like. Treechangers often came to regional cities via the stepping stones of brand new suburban developments in places like Hume or Whittlesea that are a long way from an inner-city vibe, but don’t feel too different to the outer suburbs. “Ballarat has a gin distillery right in the middle of town so if that’s your jam, you could be within 10 minutes walk of it if you chose to,” Houghton said. So four years after the start of the pandemic, the great regional migration is morphing again. People are more strategic about their desires and if they move to a place that doesn’t quite provide the services they need, they are not afraid to move on again. Work arrangements remain the key to whether treechangers pick a city or country address. Sign up toThe Rural Network Subscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairs after newsletter promotion The data shows a very simple equation. If people have to go in to work every day, they prefer a regional city. If they have a hybrid office/home arrangement, they prefer a capital city. But if they can be fully remote, they again prefer a regional city. But the hype about the work-from-home trend as a regional winner has not been fully realised. Considercompanies such as Amazonwhich are trying to draw their workers back to the office, at the very least on a hybrid model. Some of the most critical jobs on the ground in regional places are those that require workers to show up every day, such as childcare, healthcare and education. So that preference for living and working in a regional city if you have to make a daily commute might bode well for regional communities. Finally, there was an idea that people would see the folly of their ways and, faced with lack of services and distance, would relocate back to a capital city. That is not borne out by the data. It is true to say, just because a place has attracted new residents, it doesn’t mean it will keep them. For example, the Ahuri research found that the likelihood of population churn was high across its case study areas of Port Macquarie, Ballarat and Broken Hill, with the highest number of survey respondents (44%) stating they were likely to move away in the next five years in Broken Hill. But it is more likely they will move to another regional place, rather than back to the city. Survey respondents stated they would most likely move to other regional cities (46%) rather than capital cities (30%) if they were to move away from the case study areas, which is still counter to the overall urbanisation trend in Australia. After years of trying to attract population, the biggest issue for local regional policymakers and planners is now anticipating population growth and the services, such as childcare, medical services and schools, needed to keep those new residents. Small places will rise and fall but regional cities, especially coastal ones, will continue to grow if they have the conditions right. It would seem the regional renaissance is not over.

‘Where’d you find tyres that size?’ Giant red tractor is Australia’s newest Big Thing,,"On the flat plains of midwestWestern Australia, three hours north of Perth, there is a new marker on the horizon. A red tractor, standing 11.5 metres tall and 16 metres long, dominates the skyline of the small town of Carnamah. The tractor is an exact replica of a Chamberlain 40K, built to five times the scale. It is the world’s biggest tractor statue, and the latest addition to Australia’scatalogue of Big Things. The tractor was unveiled to a crowd of more than 2,000 people on Saturday. The tyres posed the biggest challenge in construction, says the retired farmer Bob Lukins, one of the men who spearheaded the project. They’re 7.8 metres in diameter, larger than the biggest commercially available tyres. “When people saw it they said, ‘where’d you find tyres that size?’ Because they look like tyres, until you tap them,” Lukins says. “They are not tyres, they are fabricated steel.” Lukins is one of the founding members of the WA Vintage Tractor and Machinery Association, or Tracmach, which was formed in 1981 and now has 600 members. In 1986, he says, they started talking about the idea of building a giant tractor somewhere in the WA wheatbelt, to showcase the state’s agricultural history and act as an advertisement for Tracmach’s machinery field days. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter But they never had the money or the government buy-in. Six years ago, they connected with a retired machinery dealer in Carnamah who put them in contact with the Carnamah historical society. The local shire got on board, but the project still didn’t have any money. “We applied for every grant there was,” Lukins says. “We got every one knocked back.” Eventually they connected with Frank Kidman, an engineer who agreed to waive the $20,000 design fee in lieu of the big tractor committee buying him the technical equipment needed to draw up the plans. “We got a Chamberlain 40K and we put it outside his back door, right off his deck,” Lukins says. “He measured every single part on that tractor, put it in the computer and five-timesed it. It took him more than 400 hours.” The Chamberlain 40K was chosen for its importance to WA agriculture. The machines were designed by the Victorian tractor mechanic Bob Chamberlain, who designed the prototype in the 1930s specifically for large landholdings like those in the expanding wheatbelt, midwest and Esperance cropping regions of WA. The tractors were manufactured in an ex-munitions factory in the Perth suburb of Welshpool and the first Chamberlain 40Ks rolled off the line in 1949. At 40 horsepower and weighing one tonne, the tractors were bigger and more suited to WA conditions than other tractors on the market at that time. In commemorating the tractor, Lukins says they are also honouring the work done by “our fathers, grandfathers, and their wives” in establishing the farming region. “The sheer hard work that those men and women did in those early days, firstly with horses and then with those early tractors, helped to get us to the stage that we are now where we all have a very high standard of living. And it’s now a little bit forgotten,” he says. The statue was constructed piece by piece by the mining contractor DIAB Engineering, in the nearby town of Geraldton. Sixty people worked on it over 17 months. It was delivered to Carnamah on six prime mover trucks and assembled, with final paint touch-ups, over the course of a week. The entire project has been funded through community fundraising efforts. Led by Tracmach’s president, John Piavanni, and Brendan Haeusler from the Big Tractor Project, the fundraising has netted $600,000 in private and corporate donations and some regional development grants, but the total cost for the project is $750,000. “We have not finished paying for it yet. We still have to raise a bit more money,” Lukins says. “But it’s a huge achievement for the Tracmach organisation. It puts WA and Australia on the map.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter",Calla Wahlquist,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/calla-wahlquist,,the-rural-network,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/08/giant-red-tractor-carnamah-wa-australias-big-things

Political and media figures pay tribute to former first minister Alex Salmond,,"Politicians and commentators in the UK have been paying tribute toAlex Salmondafter the death of the former first minister of Scotland on Saturday. Keir Starmer called Salmond a “monumental figure of Scottish and UK politics”. The prime minister said: “For more than 30 years, Alex Salmond was a monumental figure of Scottish and UK politics. He leaves behind a lasting legacy. “As first minister ofScotlandhe cared deeply about Scotland’s heritage, history and culture, as well as the communities he represented as MP and MSP over many years of service. “My thoughts are with those who knew him, his family and his loved ones. On behalf of the UK government, I offer them our condolences today.” The Conservative leader, Rishi Sunak, posted on X: “Alex Salmond was a huge figure in our politics. While I disagreed with him on the constitutional question, there was no denying his skill in debate or his passion for politics. May he rest in peace.” King Charles also paid tribute later on Saturday. He said in a message issued by Buckingham Palace: “My wife and I are greatly saddened to hear of the sudden death of Alex Salmond. “His devotion to Scotland drove his decades of public service. We extend our deep condolences to his family and loved ones at this time.” Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, said: “I am deeply shocked and saddened at the untimely death of the former first minister Alex Salmond, and I extend my deepest condolences to Alex’s wife, Moira, and to his family. “Over many years, Alex made an enormous contribution to political life – not just within Scotland, but across the UK and beyond. “Alex worked tirelessly and fought fearlessly for the country that he loved and for her independence. He took the Scottish National party from the fringes ofScottish politicsinto government and led Scotland so close to becoming an independent country. “There will be much more opportunity to reflect in the coming days, but today all of our thoughts are with Alex’s family and his many friends right across the political spectrum.” Ash Regan, Edinburgh Eastern MSP and Alba leader at Holyrood, posted on X: “A tour de force in politics, who took us close to independence. Alex had the nation believe in itself.

"Alex Salmond, former first minister of Scotland, dies aged 69",,"Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland who led Scotland to the brink of independence, has died at the age of 69. Salmond served as first minister ofScotlandfrom 2007. He stood down from the role after failing to secure independence in the 2014 referendum, handing over to his deputy, Nicola Sturgeon. Reports suggested that he collapsed after delivering a speech in North Macedonia on Saturday. Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, said he was “deeply shocked and saddened”. “Alex worked tirelessly and fought fearlessly for the country that he loved and for her independence.

He was my mentor, and for more than a decade we formed one of the most successful partnerships in UK politics. “Alex modernised the SNP and led us into government for the first time, becoming Scotland’s fourth first minister and paving the way for the 2014 referendum which took Scotland to the brink of independence. “He will be remembered for all of that. My thoughts are with Moira, his wider family and his friends.” The former SNP leader and former first minister Humza Yousaf said Salmond had “helped to transform the SNP into the dominant political force it is today. “Alex and I obviously had our differences in the last few years, but there’s no doubt about the enormous contribution he made to Scottish and UK politics.” Anas Sarwar, the leader of Scottish Labour, said the “sad news of Alex Salmond’s passing today will come as a shock to all who knew him in Scotland, across the UK and beyond”. He described him as “a central figure in politics over three decades” whose “contribution to the Scottish political landscape cannot be overstated”.

Above all, I shall remember him as an inspiration and a loyal friend. My heartfelt condolences go to Moira, his family, and all who loved him.” Salmond began his second stint as SNP leader in 2004, securing power in Holyrood in 2007. That was followed by a sweeping victory in Scottish parliamentary elections in 2011 – the precursor to the independence vote. Salmond was a huge but divisive figure, gaining criticism for his appearances on the Russian state channel RT. He quit the channel after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. He resigned from the SNP in 2018, after allegations of sexual misconduct during his time as first minister in 2013. After lengthy legal battles, he was arrested in 2019 and charged with 14 offences. He was acquitted of all charges of sexual assault in 2020, when he was found not guilty of 12 charges of attempted rape, sexual assault and indecent assault after six hours of jury deliberations. The jury reached the uniquely Scottish verdict of “not proven” on one charge of sexual assault with intent to rape. Another charge was dropped. The subsequent Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government’s handling of the initial harassment complaints led to huge splits within the SNP, with some senior figures backing Salmond, and accusations that he had been the victim of a witch-hunt within the party. He went on to form theAlbaparty in 2021, which challenged the SNP on its failure to deliver a second referendum but failed to make electoral headway. Salmond was rumoured to be considering a return to frontline politics at Holyrood at the next Scottish parliament elections in 2026, with speculation that he might stand for the regional list in the north-east of Scotland. Reflecting recently on the referendum result, Salmond said he had started to write his concession speech after the first result was declared on the night of the vote. The yes campaign lost the vote, 45% to 55%. The first result came from Clackmannanshire, often seen as reflecting national sentiment. Voters there backed staying within the UK by 53.8% to 46.2%. “When I saw that result, I started to write my concession speech,” Salmond said. “Nobody gave us a chance at the start. I always reckoned if we got to the positive side of the argument, if we claimed the positive side for ‘yes’, which in itself is an affirmation, then once we got into the campaign, I thought we’d pick up ground, and so we did.”",Michael Savage,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-savage,,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/12/alex-salmond-dies-aged-69-in-north-macedonia
‘Incomparable’ Alex Salmond made Scottish nationalism soar before he and SNP soured,,"The flags on the Scottish parliament building were lowered on Saturday evening to mark the passing ofAlex Salmond, who transformed the Scottish National party and led Scotland to the brink of independence as first minister. Voices cross-party and around the worldrushed to praise the achievements of this consummate and divisive politician, who dominated the Scottish political landscape for decades. And within the SNP itself, which he moulded into a dynamic, confident, election-winning operation, there was shock and raw grief. But his post-referendum legacy was dominated bythe collapse of the defining relationship of his political career with Nicola Sturgeon, who succeeded him as first minister and regarded him as her mentor. A decade on from that referendum, on Saturday there was also quiet reflection among SNP veterans on the bitter legacy of the events of the past seven years that caused Salmond to angrily quit his membership and found another pro-independence party – called Alba, the Gaelic forScotland– to rival it. It was Sturgeon whom Salmond blamed for how the Scottish government handled initial complaints of sexual harassment made against him – resulting in a criminal trial in which he was sensationallyacquitted of all charges– anda Holyrood inquiry. “It was a sundering among a comparatively small group of people who were very close and had taken the party to where it was,” said Michael Russell, former Scottish government minister and SNP chief executive under Salmond, and another member of that inner circle along with the current first minister, John Swinney. “It was very hard but this is the moment to reflect on his achievements.” “There was nobody to compare him to,” said Russell, who was Salmond’s campaign manager when he first became leader in 1990. “The party recognised early on that he was an exceptional talent.” “He was on a personal campaign to convert every person in Scotland. He had that ability to connect with people and also have a strategic view.” He also knew “the value of being seen”, said Russell, and was instrumental in raising the profile of the SNP to the point where voters considered it potentially a party of government. Yet arguably Salmond was the successful leader he became because of his relationship with Sturgeon – she carried the SNP at Holyrood while he was in Westminster in the mid 2000s, and broadened the referendum campaign to appeal to younger, leftwing, urban voters. Ifthe independence referendum of 2014was the high-water mark of their relationship, after losing his Westminster seat in 2017 he refused to step back and take on the elder statesman role that was waiting for him, making things difficult for his successor. To her dismay he opted to sign a broadcasting deal with the Kremlin-funded broadcaster Russia Today and became an Edinburgh fringe host, trotting out sexist jokes. While he became an increasingly divisive figure, it is hard to overstate his impact on firstScottish politicsand then the independence cause. Salmond joined the party he would eventually lead in 1973, as a student at St Andrews University and worked as an economist for Royal Bank of Scotland after graduation. But he was also a political radical as one of the 79 Group, which wanted the SNP to move to the left and capture disaffected Labour voters who were disappointed with the UK government’s failure to deliver devolution. Elected to Westminster in 1987, he took over the party leadership in 1990, and his flair for debating was evident as he relished the role of opposition leader in the first Scottish parliament. His fondness for betting on horse racing was well known, and likewise his political career was marked by moments where he took extreme gambles that paid off. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Immediately after the 2007 Holyrood elections, in which the SNP had won just one seat more than the incumbent Labour, in a parliament designed for coalition, Salmond made an audacious media statement standing in front of a helicopter insisting that his party had won and would form the next minority government. His rivals fell into line. A brilliant strategist, he trained candidates to “act like winners”, effectively breaking the Holyrood system by winning a majority in 2011, the only time any party has achieved this in the 25 years of devolution. This pro-independence majority paved the way for the historic deal with the then UK prime minister, David Cameron, to hold a single-question referendum in 2014 on whether Scotland should be an independent country. “He changed the script and in doing so he changed Scotland’s story,” said Eilidh Whiteford, who succeeded Salmond as MP for the Banff and Buchan constituency after he returned to Holyrood as SNP leader. “I was very lucky to have him as a friend, mentor and boss and owe him a great deal. He was hugely demanding to work for but also enormous fun. And he had the best ambitions for the country.” Fergus Mutch, a former Salmond adviser, said that Salmond “loved to be out and about”. “He took an interest in people and had time for everybody,” Mutch said, attributing this to how Salmond had recognised the growing discontent with Labour in Scotland as an opportunity for the nationalists. “Like any politician he looked studiously at the opinion polls but he found no better guide than talking to voters.” And while Salmond could be “an absolute taskmaster”, he also “knew the value of friendship, camaraderie and kicking back with a few drinks”.",Libby Brooks,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/libbybrooks,,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/12/incomparable-alex-salmond-made-scottish-nationalism-soar-before-he-and-snp-soured

Trump makes gains as poll figures trigger anxiety for Harris campaign,,"Tightening poll figures have triggered nervousness and anxiety in Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, with Donald Trump making gains in the states where it matters most as the election race enters its climactic final phase. Amid a dramatic news cycle that has seen the US hit by two destructive hurricanes and rising fears of all-out war in the Middle East, the Guardian’s 10-day polling average tracker showed the vice-president and Democratic nominee with a two-point nationwide lead, 48% to 46%, over her Republican opponent as of 10 October - tellingly, down from a 4% advantage she registered two weeks ago. More plainly worrying for theDemocratsis the picture it paints in what are generally regarded as the seven key battleground states that will determine who ends up in the White House: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. All seven show minuscule differences between the candidates that are within the margin of error. Crucially, Harris enjoys just three – fractional leads in Nevada and Michigan, and a slim one-point advantage in Pennsylvania. Trump has wafer-thin leads in the five remaining swing states. If that were to be replicated when voters go to the polls on 5 November, it would get Trump past the 270 electoral college votes threshold needed for victory and propel him back to the Oval Office. The crumb of comfort for Harris is that, with multiple surveys telling contradictory tales when the details are scrutinised, that particular outcome probably won’t happen. Indeed, a simulation using polling, economic and demographic data fromFiveThirtyEightstill had Harris winning the election 55 times out of 100, as of Thursday lunchtime. And aWall Street Journal surveyon Friday also painted a brighter outlook by showing Harris maintaining slight leads in Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia – enough to give her a narrow electoral college win if borne out on polling day. Yet the margins are perplexing for Democratic strategists, given that the vice-president’s campaign recently disclosed that it had raised $1bn within 80 days of Harris replacing Joe Biden as the party’s nominee in July. The amount greatly surpasses that raised by Trump’s campaign. By late August, Trump’s campaign had brought in a relatively modest $309m, although it has the advantage of financial support from entrepreneur Elon Musk’s Super Pac, which isoffering cash incentivesto people in swing states to register Trump-friendly voters. Whatever the cash advantages, Harris seems to have lost some momentum in the “blue wall” Rust belt battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania since her 10 September debate performance against Trump in Philadelphia, when she was generally seen as coming out on top. That was illustrated by a Quinnipiac University poll last Wednesday that recorded the five-point lead she held in Michigan in the week following the debate being transformed into a three-point advantage for Trump, 50% to 47%; in Wisconsin, a one-point post-debate advantage turned into a 2% lead for Trump. And in Pennsylvania, a six-point Harris lead was halved to 3%. One issue casting a shadow over Harris’s prospects is the intensifying conflict in the Middle East, with Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese Shia group, threatening to further erode support among the large ethnic Arab voting bloc in Michigan that was already angry over the White House’s backing of the Israeli war against Hamas in Gaza. Quinnipiac’s survey shows Trump with significant leads on the issue in both Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump has apparently become so confident of victory that he has begun moving beyond the battlegrounds to stage rallies in Democratic strongholds such as California, Illinois and New York, despite polls indicating he has little chance of winning there. The move seems calculated to project an air of impending triumph. With just 24 days left before polling day, time is running out for Harris to correct her poll stutters, Democratic strategists fear. The timetable has been further curtailed by the twin storms, Hurricanes Helene and Milton, that have buffeted the south-east of the US in the past two weeks, diverting Harris from the campaign trail and presenting Trump with an opportunity to spout lies and falsehoods about her and Biden’s supposed failure to mount a recovery effort. “I’m very, very concerned and very scared,”James Carville, the acknowledged mastermind of Bill Clinton’s successful 1992 campaign and author of its signature slogan – “It’s the economy, stupid,” – told MSNBC last week. Warning of limited time for Harris to communicate a more aggressive message to voters, Carville continued: “Today is gone. You’re going to lose four to the hurricane … and everything kind of shuts down the Saturday before the election. So you’re really probably under 20 days that you have to really get a message out.” Calling for a targeted attack on Trump’s plan to impose import tariffs – which economists have warned will stoke inflation – he added: “They need to be sharp. They need to be aggressive. They need to stop answering questions and start asking questions.” But amid the gathering gloom, glimmers of light remain for Harris. Though survey after survey give Trump clear leads on issues of greatest importance to voters – namely, the economy, inflation and rising costs, and immigration – a majority of voters feel the country is headed in the wrong direction. And just as Harris has been unable to convert her financial reserves into clear poll leads, Trump is exhibiting a similar failing despite having the edge on some headline issues. The reason, the Wall Street Journal suggested, may be that his lead on economic issues is more nuanced than at first sight. For instance, Harris has a 6% advantage on bread-and-butter questions indicating that she “cares about people like you”. Likewise, while a majority said Trump has the right experience to be president, 48% said he was “too extreme”, compared with 34% who said the same about Harris, according to the paper’s poll. Harris may have failed to land an electoral knockout, but her opponent – for all his bombast and resilience – has vulnerabilities and weaknesses that make a victory on points within reach.",Robert Tait,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/roberttait,,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/kamala-harris-donald-trump-polls
Kamala Harris releases medical report saying she is in ‘excellent health’,,"Kamala Harrison Saturday releaseda report on her health and medical history, which found that “she possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency” if voters elect her in November. A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president’s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions aboutDonald Trump’s physical fitness and mental acuity. The 78-year-old Republican White House nominee would be the oldest president elected if Americans gave him a second term in the Oval Office. Saturday’s report – in the form of atwo-page letterfrom the vice-president’s physician, Joshua Simmons – described Harris as being in “excellent health” and asserted that her medical history was notable for seasonal allergies and hives. Harris manages those conditions with over-the-counter medications such as Allegra, Atrovent nasal spray and Pataday eye drops, and she has been on allergen immunotherapy for three years, the letter said. Otherwise, Harris is mildly nearsighted and wears corrective contact lenses as a result, had abdominal surgery when she was three years old and has a maternal history of colon cancer. “She has no personal history of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, neurological disorders, cancer or osteoporosis,” said the letter from Simmons, who added that the vice-president’s most recent physical examination in April was “unremarkable”. The statement on Harris’s health came on Saturday as Trump has becomeincreasingly incoherentat campaign rallies, something the Guardian US reported on earlier in October. He has been slurring, stumbling over his words, hurling expletives – and showing signs of cognitive decline consistent with someone approaching his 80s, according to medical experts. Recent speeches have seen him rant about topics ranging from his purportedly “beautiful” body to “a million Rambos” in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Harris campaign aides pointed to Trump’s backing out of an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes that the vice-president granted and his refusal to debate her again after their 10 September face-off. They argue that the former president is “avoiding public scrutiny” and giving voters “the impression … that he has something to hide and may not be up for the job”. “Contrast her age and vitality with his,” the senior aide to Harris, 59, said early on Saturday. Trump hasrepeatedly declined to release detailed information about his healthduring his public life. For instance, before winning the White House in 2016, he only offered a four-paragraph letter from his personal doctor that bragged that Trump would be “the healthiest person ever elected to the presidency”, as the New York Times recently reported. Trump’s first physical as president resulted in perhaps the most detailed overview of his health to date. According to the Times, the physical flagged “worryingly high” cholesterol and a body mass index that left him 0.1 points below the threshold for medical obesity. Nonetheless, in a statement on Saturday, a Trump campaign spokesperson claimed the former president regularly distributed medical updates and that all “have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be commander in chief”. “It is said [Harris] does not have the stamina of … Trump,” the campaign spokesperson’s statement also said. Questions over whetherJoe Bidenwas too enfeebled forced him to halt his bid for re-election to the presidency during the summer. The 81-year-old Democrat dropped out of a rematch with Trump on 21 July and endorsed Harris to succeed him. Recentnational polling averagesshow Harris with a two-point edge over Trump in the 5 November race for the presidency. But key swing states remain too close to call, and most experts expect a competitive election. The Republican party chose Trump as their nominee despite his being convicted in May of criminally falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments to an adult film actor who claimed an extramarital sexual encounter with him about a decade before his successful run for the presidency in 2016. Among other legal problems, he is grappling with criminal charges that he tried to illicitly overturn his defeat to Biden in the 2020 election. Trump, for his part, has maintained that Biden “became mentally impaired”. He also said that Harris “was born that way” while struggling to pronounce the vice-president’s name. At a town hall in Las Vegas for a group of undecided voters on Thursday, Harris said “using language that’s belittling … [is not] healthy for our nation”. “I don’t admire that,” Harris said. “And in fact, I’m quite critical of it coming from someone who wants to be president of the United States.”",Ramon Antonio Vargas,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ramon-antonio-vargas,,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/kamala-harris-to-release-health-report-saying-she-is-fit-for-presidency-aide
‘The fear is unspeakable’: airstrikes on northern Gaza leave hundreds of thousands with nowhere to go,,"At least 22 people have been killed in airstrikes in northern Gaza, with Israeli forces stepping up their campaign on the besieged Palestinian territory even as fighting in the new war in Lebanon escalates. On Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) renewed its evacuation orders for Palestinians still living in the decimated northern half ofGaza, although many residents say the fighting and Israeli sniper fire make it impossible to leave. Avichay Adraee, an IDF spokesperson, told people that the area includes parts of Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood and sections around Jabalia, the urban refugee camp. In a social media post, Adraee asked people living there to head south to al-Mawasi, a coastal area of southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of people are already displaced. A total of 84% of the territory is currently under evacuation orders, pushing civilians into ever-dwindling “humanitarian zones” which Israel has bombed regardless. The UN says an estimated400,000 people are trappedby the latest ground fighting and artillery fire centred in Jabalia, which has now entered a second week. “It is getting tougher every day. The fear and the conditions are unspeakable,” said Badr Alzaharna, 25, from Gaza City. “I cannot leave. I want to travel but I can’t. Rafah crossing has been closed since May.” Gaza’s ministry of health appealed on Friday for medical teams to be allowed access to the northern half of the strip to evacuate the wounded, and for fuel deliveries to the north’s struggling hospitals, warning that civilians caught up in the intense shelling and airstrikes are running out of food and water. Seven World Health Organization missions were impeded from access to northern Gaza by Israeli forces this week, the UN body said. Also on Saturday, the World Food Programme, the UN food agency, reported that no food aid has reached northern Gaza since 1 October, with a 35% drop in the supply of food to families around the rest of Gaza, raising new fears ofextreme hunger and faminethat have already plagued the strip for a year. The last food supplies – canned food, flour, high-energy biscuits and nutrition supplements – have been distributed to shelters and health facilities in the north, and it is unclear how long they will last. Israel has consistently denied blocking aid and food to Gaza. Airstrikes overnight on Friday on Jabalia destroyed an entire building and severely damaged several more, according to medics and first responders, who are still recovering missing people from under the rubble and ruins created by a 20-metre deep impact crater. At least six women and seven children were among the dead, and a strike in another part of Jabalia in the early hours of Saturday killed two parents and injured their baby, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said. Hospitals across Gaza reported receiving a total of 49 bodies and 219 wounded people in the past 24 hours. Sign up toObserved Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion The IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest strikes and civilian deaths in Gaza. Israel has nominally controlled the northern half of Gaza since the beginning of the year, and has cut the territory in two by creating what it calls the Netzarim corridor, which separates what was once the densely populated Gaza City from the rest of the strip. However, it has since frequently re-entered Gaza City and other areas in the north of the strip where it says Hamas fighters are regrouping. In Lebanon, the health authority said that 60 people were killed and another 168 wounded in the past 24 hours, and the United Nations peacekeeping force that operates on the blue line separating Israel and Lebanon said its headquarters in Naqoura had been targeted a second time. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the fire. Israel stepped up its campaign against the Lebanese militia Hezbollah last month after a year of tit-for-tat fire triggered by Hamas’s 7 October attack and the ensuing war in Gaza. The new war in Lebanon has heightened the risk of a region-wide escalation drawing in Iran and the US.

Feedback loop: the tangled ties between the US election and the Middle East war,,"The year since the 7 October attack has demonstrated just how densely intertwined US presidential politics is with the trajectory of events in the Middle East. Each exerts a gravitational pull on the other, often in ways that are damaging for both. Foreign policy rarely matters much in US presidential elections, but this year could be an exception. In a contest likely to be decided by small margins in a handful of states, the fallout from the conflicts in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, with a potential war with Iran looming, could have a significant impact on Kamala Harris’s prospects. On the other side of the coin, the outcome of the election on 5 November will affect the Middle East in unpredictable but potentially momentous ways. Despite the clear limits on Washington’s ability to controlIsrael, its closest partner, the US remains by far the most influential external power in the region. Joe Biden’ssteadfast support for Israel in the face of mass civilian casualties in Gaza, and Benjamin Netanyahu’s clear defiance of US-led efforts to establish ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon, have alienated many progressive Democrats. Kamala Harris has not distanced herself in any significant way from Biden’s Middle East policy and nowfaces a particularly tough fight in Michigan, home to a sizable Arab American community. Losing that state would considerably complicate Harris’s path to the presidency. The spread of war and the outbreak of open conflict between Israel and Iran is likely to affect the presidential campaign far beyond Michigan, combining doubts over the Biden-Harris team’s foreign policy competence with the threat of an oil price rise at the worst possible time for Harris.It could be this election’s fatal “October surprise”. “You’re seeing Americans being evacuated from Beirut now and it really helps the overall Trump narrative of ‘the world’s a messier place with these weaklings’,” said Daniel Levy, the head of the US/Middle East Project policy institute. Just as the Middle East can sway US politics more than any other foreign part of the world, US politics exerts a clear and constant influence on the Middle East. Demonstrative support for Israel has become a shibboleth for both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, almost irrespective of Israel’s actions. Dana Allin, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, pointed out that Israel’s untouchability in the US political arena haddeveloped over time. “This was not the way presidents spoke in the Richard Nixon era. There is irony in this fealty insofar as the respective goals and worldviews of the two allies have never been further apart,” Allin argued. Netanyahu has vigorously enforced the American taboo against using its leverage over Israel. He has done so by mobilising the power of pro-Israel sentiment in the US against any president who has tried to rein him in. When Barack Obama announced there should be a stop to the building of settlements in the West Bank, Netanyahucalled his bluff and ignored him. When Biden put a hold on the delivery ofUS-made 2,000lb bombswhich were being used to flatten residential areas in Gaza, the Israeli prime minister declared it “unconscionable”, and later accepted a Republican invitation to address Congress and met Trump. In Biden, he was assailing a US president with more of a personal attachment to the Israeli cause than any of his predecessors, who hadflown to Israel days after the 7 October attackand literally hugged Netanyahu on the airport tarmac. The Israeli prime minister still turned on Biden at the first sign of doubt. Netanyahu’s message has been clear: any hesitation in the provision of weapons or diplomatic support will incur a heavy political cost. The US leader held responsible will be portrayed as a traitor to Israel. The result of this tactic has been a deep reluctance on the part of successive presidents to use US leverage, as Israel’s biggest arms supplier by far, to curb the excesses of the Netanyahu coalition in any meaningful way, in Gaza, the West Bank or Lebanon. Without that leverage, a succession of US ceasefire initiatives this year have come to nothing, shrugged off by Netanyahu in ways that were sometimes deeply humiliating to the US as a superpower and supposedly dominant partner in the relationship. “Netanyahu has spent a long part of his career turning America into a partisan issue, trying to convince Israelis that the fortunes of Israel are bound up with Republican leaders,” Dahlia Scheindlin, a Tel Aviv-based political analyst, said. It is unclear whether a Harris administration would steer a significantly different course to Biden’s. On one hand, Harris does not have the same personal history with Israel as Biden and, if she wins in November, would be freer to experiment with a change in policy. On the other hand, winning the election in the face of widespread Democratic discontent over the Middle East could convince Harris that the progressive threat over the issue could be discounted. “One scenario is that Kamala Harris wins and continues Joe Biden’s policies, which is kind of: we want to do the right thing, but we’re basically going to let Israel do what it wants,” Scheindlin said. “Or she could get a little tougher, in line with a more progressive wing of the Democratic party, and say: ‘We’re going to start applying American law on the export of our weapons,’ which I doubt, honestly.” It seems almost certain that Netanyahu’s decision-making is influenced by anticipation of a Trump restoration in the White House, and he is not alone. The Saudi monarchy may also be waiting for Trump’s return before signing a diplomatic normalisation agreement with Israel, though the current hostilities make such a deal unlikely in the near term. With Trump back in the White House, Netanyahu would not have to deal with US resistance to greater Israeli control, even annexation, of the West Bank. In 2019, the Trump administrationrecognised Israeli sovereigntyover the annexed Golan Heights. Trump’s former ambassador to Israel David Friedman has been auditioning for a role in a second term with a new book, One Jewish State, arguing that Israel should swallow the West Bank whole. “With Trump in the White House, annexation becomes a much more active possibility,” Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said. “It is an administration that is going to be even less concerned with Palestinian lives than the current one. They’re not even going to pay lip service to humanitarian assistance.” There is less certainty over whether a newly elected president Trump would help Netanyahu achieve his longstanding strategic goal: recruiting the US for a decisive attack on Iran’s nuclear programme. Middle East policy in Trump’s first term was built around hostility to Iran. In his last weeks in office, Trump gave the green light to theassassination of the Revolutionary Guards commanderQassem Suleimani. On the other hand, Trumpcalled off a missile strikeon Iran in June 2019 because he thought the likely civilian casualties were disproportionate for a response to the shooting down of a US drone. And one of the points of consistency in Trump foreign policy is his aversion to US involvement in foreign wars. Netanyahu may be hoping for a Trump win in November, but the consequent support from Washington is likely to be more transactional and less sentimental than Biden’s. Ram Ben-Barak, a former Israeli intelligence chief, worries that in the long term, a Trump-Netanyahu combination could end up poisoning the fundamental relationship between their two countries. “What makes our relationship with America is sharing the same values,” Ben-Barak said. “The moment you have an Israeli prime minister with no values, as we have today, and a US president without values like Trump, I’m not sure this bond will continue.”",Julian Borger,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/julianborger,,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/the-middle-east-and-the-us-election-how-they-could-affect-each-other
"The anonymous, anything-goes forum at the heart of the Pelicot rape case",,"The trial of a 71-year-old man has gripped France and horrified the world after he admitted to repeatedly drugging his wife and, over the course of decades, soliciting dozens of men online to rape her while she was unconscious.Dominique Pelicot’s confessions as well as the public bravery of his wife Gisèle have forced a nationwide reckoning over sexual assault and the double lives people lead through the internet. As a court in Avignon has heard Pelicot’s case andallegations against 50 other defendantsover the last several weeks, a pattern has emerged of men who lived publicly upstanding lives while allegedly engaging in abhorrent acts online and in private. As the men accused of mass rape have taken the stand, they have detailed how Pelicot found them and coordinated his abuse on an illicit chat forum called Coco. What has emerged during the trial is that the scale of Pelicot’s crimes and his ability to keep them concealed for so many years would seemingly not have been possible without Coco and its administrators’ disregard for the content being shared on the platform. The site has become one of the starkest examples in memory of how platforms can result in extreme harm when left unmoderated. Since its founding in 2003, Coco has been implicated in killings, pedophilia, homophobic attacks and sexual assaults as it evaded accountability and led law enforcement on an international manhunt. When European authorities finally shut down Coco earlier this year and arrested its founder along with other executives, the website had been cited in more than 23,000 reports of criminal activity and more than 480 victims had been involved in judicial proceedings involving the site, according to French prosecutors. Founded by the software engineer Isaac Steidl while he was in his early 20s, Coco launched as a free chat site with a simple interface allowing users to communicate anonymously. Although the site asked users to confirm that they were over 18, they could quickly change their age once they gained access to the platform and chat with an invented username. “It looked so innocent. It was this very 90s design, with coconut trees and a smiley face and it said “this is a website for nice people,” said Sophie Antoine, an officer for legal advocacy at the French anti-child prostitution organization ACPE. “But you went in, and it was like a jungle.” Users would encounter a public landing page once registered to the site, which featured a list of different chat forums dedicated to different subjects. The sexualized nature of the site meant that many of these forums were dedicated to specific fetishes or contained explicit content. People could also enter private chats on Coco and directly message other users, which one French journalistpretending to be a 15-year-old girlon the site found resulted in a flood of people soliciting them for sex and sending nude images. “It was very accessible and very explicit – there was no control over it,” Antoine said. Although it never gained mainstream popularity, the site became well known among child safety advocates and LGBTQ+ rights groups monitoring sites with the potential for online harm. ACPE had been involved with work on Coco for years, with Antoine training people on how to use the site for research purposes while alerting authorities to illicit and dangerous activity there. In Pelicot’s case, he used an anonymous pseudonym on Coco and solicited men on a forum called “à son insu”, meaning “without her knowledge”, to come to his house in the small town of Mazan. Pelicot claimed on the forum that he and his wife shared a fetish for men having sex with her while she was asleep, not openly mentioning that he was drugging her against her will and that she had no knowledge or consent of his abuse. While many of the men claimed they believed they were engaging in a consensual sexual roleplay, investigators found that several times Pelicot also explicitly used the words “rape” and described drugging his wife to potential attackers. Coco was unmoderated to the extent that Pelicot was able to use the forum for years without any penalty, and authorities ultimately only became aware of him after a grocery store security guard caught Pelicot attempting to take nonconsensual videos of women who were shopping in 2020. In the unlikely event that a user did get kicked off Coco due to complaints or legal threats, researchers and authorities say the site would charge a small fee of about €10 to reinstate banned accounts. Despite the site becoming a well-known haven for online abuses, rights groups and authorities faced various legal hurdles in investigating and taking legal action against it. European Union regulations for years had broad provisions that prevented a website owner from being held legally liable for the content on their site, similar toSection 230 law in the US. Coco also moved where it was hosted, complicating matters by moving from being a wholly French site to a domain registered to the self-governing island of Guernsey under a .gg URL. Holding Steidl accountable for the site he created also faced another logistical hurdle – at some point after founding the site, he moved to Bulgaria, outside the immediate reach of French authorities, and renounced his French citizenship. Even as Coco was publicly implicated in a string of violence and sexual abuse, the site remained online, with Steidl nowhere to be found. While Pelicot was using Coco to perpetrate his attacks, a slew of other abuses were taking place in forums and chats throughout the site. For years, a number of high-profile crimes involving Coco received widespread news coverage inFranceand increased calls among rights groups to shut the platform down. One of earliest cases was the 2018 killing of 55-year-old Michel Sollossi, who was killed by a 22-year-old man who had arranged to meet up with him on Coco. Sollossi was found beaten to death in his home in the Paris suburbs, with a trial finding that the killing was a homophobic attack. The perpetrator was sentenced to 20 years in prison. A wave of similar “ambush attacks” on gay men who were lured to meet up with strangers on Coco followed. In 2022, a 24-year-old from Marseille alleged that he narrowly escaped an attack by three people who tried to run him over with their car when he arrived at a meetup arranged through Coco. Law enforcement officials arrested four people in the town of Saint-Polois earlier this year after they were accused of posing as men looking for hookups on the site then luring victims to meet them before violently attacking and robbing them. While violent attacks ambushing gay men proliferated on the platform, the site was also used for child sexual abuse. A man from the north-western French city of Brestadmitted in 2019to exchanging videos of child rape using the same “without her knowledge” forum as Pelicot. In one of the most high-profile cases, the 77-year-old former French pop star Richard Dewitte was arrested after sexually soliciting an undercover officer whom he believed was a 13-year-old girl. A court sentenced Dewitte tothree years in prisonlast year.

The two boys allegedly pretended to be a girl looking to meet up on Coco, before ambushing the man and beating him to death in a parking lot when he showed up. The myriad of cases drew the attention of French LGBTQ+ rights groups such as SOS Homophobie and child protection organizations such as ACPE, which began calling for authorities to take more aggressive action against the site. “We have been talking about it for years and asking for it to be closed,” Antoine said. “But it was complicated with all the different European laws.” Coco’s ability to evade authorities relied on a combination of legal protections for internet providers, the complicated logistics of international investigations and obscured origins. Sites seeking to avoid scrutiny use a variety of tools to mask exactly where they are operating, forcing law enforcement to peel back layers of obfuscations before finding the origins and owners of a site. When authorities finally came for Coco, it involved an immense, 18-month international effort and a recent change in French law. In December 2023, France’s national anti-organized crime authority Junalco launched an investigation into Coco that utilized a 2023 law called “délit d’administration de plateforme”, which can hold administrators liable for certain activities on their sites. The law allows authorities to accuse site founders of complicity in crimes such as their sites or apps being used for illicit transactions that fund gangs. Violations carry penalties of up to 10 years in jail as well as fines up to €500,000. Prosecutors used the same law to issue a preliminary charge against the billionaire Telegram CEO, Pavel Durov, following his arrest earlier this year. Durov’s arrestgained international attentionand prompted a debate over the extent to which governments should hold platforms accountable for illegal content. Along with Junalco, agencies from countries including Lithuania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany and the Netherlands coordinated an effort to bring Coco down in June of this year. International authorities shut down servers based in Germany, seized about €5.6m and froze several bank accounts related to the site. In Bulgaria, local authorities arrested and interviewed Steidl with French prosecutors present as observers. Three of Steidl’s associates including his wife were also detained for questioning in France and later released,accordingto national media and a Junalco press release. French prosecutors have not issued statements on what the next steps in the criminal case involving Coco and Steidl may be, but the site remains offline. LGBTQ+ rights groups and anti-child abuse organizations have celebrated the closure while warning that similar sites may fill the vacuum. The Pelicot trial is meanwhile still ongoing as French society grapples with how such acts, committed by men from a variety of ages and backgrounds, could go undetected for so long. It’s a question that advocates against sexual abuse say involves the country reconsidering how these crimes happen, and who perpetrates them. “We are trying to dismantle the idea that these criminals are monsters,” Antoine said. “The Mazan case showed with websites like Coco these people can be your neighbors – even in the smallest town people can connect online and commit these crimes.” Kari Paul contributed reporting",Nick Robins-Early,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nick-robins-early,2024-10-12,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/coco-website-pelicot-rape-trial
"The anonymous, anything-goes forum at the heart of the Pelicot rape case",,"The trial of a 71-year-old man has gripped France and horrified the world after he admitted to repeatedly drugging his wife and, over the course of decades, soliciting dozens of men online to rape her while she was unconscious.Dominique Pelicot’s confessions as well as the public bravery of his wife Gisèle have forced a nationwide reckoning over sexual assault and the double lives people lead through the internet. As a court in Avignon has heard Pelicot’s case andallegations against 50 other defendantsover the last several weeks, a pattern has emerged of men who lived publicly upstanding lives while allegedly engaging in abhorrent acts online and in private. As the men accused of mass rape have taken the stand, they have detailed how Pelicot found them and coordinated his abuse on an illicit chat forum called Coco. What has emerged during the trial is that the scale of Pelicot’s crimes and his ability to keep them concealed for so many years would seemingly not have been possible without Coco and its administrators’ disregard for the content being shared on the platform. The site has become one of the starkest examples in memory of how platforms can result in extreme harm when left unmoderated. Since its founding in 2003, Coco has been implicated in killings, pedophilia, homophobic attacks and sexual assaults as it evaded accountability and led law enforcement on an international manhunt. When European authorities finally shut down Coco earlier this year and arrested its founder along with other executives, the website had been cited in more than 23,000 reports of criminal activity and more than 480 victims had been involved in judicial proceedings involving the site, according to French prosecutors. Founded by the software engineer Isaac Steidl while he was in his early 20s, Coco launched as a free chat site with a simple interface allowing users to communicate anonymously. Although the site asked users to confirm that they were over 18, they could quickly change their age once they gained access to the platform and chat with an invented username. “It looked so innocent. It was this very 90s design, with coconut trees and a smiley face and it said “this is a website for nice people,” said Sophie Antoine, an officer for legal advocacy at the French anti-child prostitution organization ACPE. “But you went in, and it was like a jungle.” Users would encounter a public landing page once registered to the site, which featured a list of different chat forums dedicated to different subjects. The sexualized nature of the site meant that many of these forums were dedicated to specific fetishes or contained explicit content. People could also enter private chats on Coco and directly message other users, which one French journalistpretending to be a 15-year-old girlon the site found resulted in a flood of people soliciting them for sex and sending nude images. “It was very accessible and very explicit – there was no control over it,” Antoine said. Although it never gained mainstream popularity, the site became well known among child safety advocates and LGBTQ+ rights groups monitoring sites with the potential for online harm. ACPE had been involved with work on Coco for years, with Antoine training people on how to use the site for research purposes while alerting authorities to illicit and dangerous activity there. In Pelicot’s case, he used an anonymous pseudonym on Coco and solicited men on a forum called “à son insu”, meaning “without her knowledge”, to come to his house in the small town of Mazan. Pelicot claimed on the forum that he and his wife shared a fetish for men having sex with her while she was asleep, not openly mentioning that he was drugging her against her will and that she had no knowledge or consent of his abuse. While many of the men claimed they believed they were engaging in a consensual sexual roleplay, investigators found that several times Pelicot also explicitly used the words “rape” and described drugging his wife to potential attackers. Coco was unmoderated to the extent that Pelicot was able to use the forum for years without any penalty, and authorities ultimately only became aware of him after a grocery store security guard caught Pelicot attempting to take nonconsensual videos of women who were shopping in 2020. In the unlikely event that a user did get kicked off Coco due to complaints or legal threats, researchers and authorities say the site would charge a small fee of about €10 to reinstate banned accounts. Despite the site becoming a well-known haven for online abuses, rights groups and authorities faced various legal hurdles in investigating and taking legal action against it. European Union regulations for years had broad provisions that prevented a website owner from being held legally liable for the content on their site, similar toSection 230 law in the US. Coco also moved where it was hosted, complicating matters by moving from being a wholly French site to a domain registered to the self-governing island of Guernsey under a .gg URL. Holding Steidl accountable for the site he created also faced another logistical hurdle – at some point after founding the site, he moved to Bulgaria, outside the immediate reach of French authorities, and renounced his French citizenship. Even as Coco was publicly implicated in a string of violence and sexual abuse, the site remained online, with Steidl nowhere to be found. While Pelicot was using Coco to perpetrate his attacks, a slew of other abuses were taking place in forums and chats throughout the site. For years, a number of high-profile crimes involving Coco received widespread news coverage inFranceand increased calls among rights groups to shut the platform down. One of earliest cases was the 2018 killing of 55-year-old Michel Sollossi, who was killed by a 22-year-old man who had arranged to meet up with him on Coco. Sollossi was found beaten to death in his home in the Paris suburbs, with a trial finding that the killing was a homophobic attack. The perpetrator was sentenced to 20 years in prison. A wave of similar “ambush attacks” on gay men who were lured to meet up with strangers on Coco followed. In 2022, a 24-year-old from Marseille alleged that he narrowly escaped an attack by three people who tried to run him over with their car when he arrived at a meetup arranged through Coco. Law enforcement officials arrested four people in the town of Saint-Polois earlier this year after they were accused of posing as men looking for hookups on the site then luring victims to meet them before violently attacking and robbing them. While violent attacks ambushing gay men proliferated on the platform, the site was also used for child sexual abuse. A man from the north-western French city of Brestadmitted in 2019to exchanging videos of child rape using the same “without her knowledge” forum as Pelicot. In one of the most high-profile cases, the 77-year-old former French pop star Richard Dewitte was arrested after sexually soliciting an undercover officer whom he believed was a 13-year-old girl. A court sentenced Dewitte tothree years in prisonlast year.

Starmer steps into cabinet row over P&O to rescue global summit in London,,"Keir Starmer expressed his full confidence on Saturday in the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, after an explosive cabinet row cast fresh doubt over his Downing Street operation and threatened to overshadow a key international investment summit in London. Government sources said the prime minister and Haigh had spoken and made up on Saturday after Starmer appeared to rebuke her on Friday for branding P&O Ferries a “rogue operator” in a statement and then calling for customers to boycott the company in a subsequent media interview. The comments – and a description by the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, of P&O’s behaviour as “outrageous” when itsacked nearly 800 workerswithout notice in 2022 – led to reports that P&O’s parent company, DP World, had pulled out of Monday’s investment summit andshelved a £1bn infrastructure projectat the London Gateway. The workers sacked in March 2022 were told of their fate by the company in pre-recorded Zoom video. They were told: “I am sorry to inform you that your employment is terminated with immediate effect … your final day of employment is today.” P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite subsequentlyappeared before the Commons business select committeeover the sacking scandal later that month. Darren Jones, then committee chair and now chief secretary to the Treasury, opened the session by asking: “Are you just a shameless criminal?” Hebblethwaite told MPs the ferry business was not viable without the changes, adding: “I would make this decision again, I’m afraid.” With DP World’s attendance at the investment summit in doubt, Starmer was asked on Friday if Haigh had been wrong to describe the company as a “cowboy operator” and to encourage a boycott. The prime minister appeared to cut her adrift, saying: “Well, look, that’s not the view of the government.” Official sources said early on Saturday they were astonished that Haigh had been “hung out to dry” and “thrown under the bus” because she had only been echoing a government press release about new protections for seafarers, which had mentioned “rogue employers” and specifically said the measures were aimed at “preventing another P&O scandal”. The release had been signed off by the No 10 communications team. “No 10 comms gave it the tick,” said a well-placed source. Both Haigh and Rayner were said by insiders to be “hopping mad” that No 10 had not protected them, given that it had sanctioned the same kind of highly critical language towards P&O. Downing Street sources later said that while the row had been smoothed over, it had been Haigh’s comments about a boycott that had gone too far and caused most annoyance to P&O’s owners. On Saturday night, it appeared that DP World would, after all, attend the conference and that the investment of £1bn was no longer under threat. Senior sources confirmed that Haigh and Starmer had spoken on the phone and that he had expressed his confidence in her. TheObserveralso understands that senior ministers, including Haigh, had not been informed in advance that DP World would be attending the investment summit, nor that they had been proposing a £1bn investment that would be announced at it. They said the fact that they were not informed was “astonishing”, given that the government last week unveiled itskey bill to improve workers’ rightsand that this was highly relevant in that context. “It shows the tension between the workers’ rights stuff and the investment stuff. This is going to keep happening unless we sort out the comms and the grid,” said an insider. The row comes just days after Starmer’s chief of staff, the former senior civil servantSue Gray, quit after weeks of bitter internal argumentsand tensions inside No 10. She was replaced by another of the prime minister’s closest aides,Morgan McSweeney. The investment summit has been talked up as a showpiece of the new government, aimed at attracting foreign money to the UK. Both Starmer and the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, will attend, as well as many of the world’s leading business figures. TheLabourMP Liam Byrne, chair of Westminster’s business and trade committee, said on BBC Radio 4’sTodayprogramme on Saturday: “I think there’s a bit of a split here between the past and the future. Lou Haigh was absolutely right to say the behaviour of P&O, owned by DP World, in the past has been completely unacceptable. “The calls for the boycott, let’s not forget, were originally made by Grant Shapps [the former Tory transport secretary] … but now we have got the employment rights bill coming through, I think we are all expecting businesses to play by the rules.” The Dubai-based company owns the port of Southampton as well as London Gateway and was involved in the creation of some of the first of Rishi Sunak’s controversial freeports. The latest Downing Street row comes as the government rolls out a series of announcements designed to underline its pro-business credentials before the summit. Sign up toObserved Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion It includes the appointment of a new industrial strategy advisory council, which will be chaired by the chief executive of Microsoft UK, Clare Barclay, as ministers unveil the first industrial strategy in seven years. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said the new strategy would “hardwire stability for investors and give them the confidence to plan not just for the next year but for the next 10 years and beyond”. He said: “This is the next step in our pro-worker, pro-business plan, which will see investors and workers alike get the security and stability they need to succeed.” Reeves said:“I have never been more optimistic about our country’s potential. We have some of the brightest minds and greatest businesses in the world, from the creative industries and life sciences to advanced manufacturing and financial services. “This government is determined to deliver on Britain’s potential so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better off.” “Are you a shameless criminal?”: how DP World’s subsidiary P&O Ferries was attacked by everyone from Boris Johnson to Keir Starmer 17 March 2022P&O Ferries tells nearly 800 staff in a pre-recorded Zoom video: “I am sorry to inform you that your employment is terminated with immediate effect.” They included those on the Dover to Calais and Liverpool to Dublin routes. 23 March 2022Prime minister Boris Johnson condemns the “callous behaviour” of P&O Ferries. He said it appeared the company had broken the law and could “face fines running into millions of pounds”. Employment lawyers tell the BBC it was unlikely employment law had been broken. 24 March 2022Peter Hebblethwaite, boss of P&O Ferries, is quizzed by the Commons’ business select committee. Darren Jones, now chief secretary to the Treasury, asks: “Are you just a shameless criminal?” Hebblethwaite tells MPs: “I’d make this decision again.” Cheaper staff would make the business viable, he said, at £5.50 an hour, plus pension contribution, food and accommodation. 30 March 2022Transport secretary Grant Shapps tells MPs the “shameful” sackings exploited a loophole, flagging vessels in Cyprus to avoid UK laws. 30 May 2022Ministers are said to have cancelled a Home Office contract with P&O Ferries to provide transport for UK Border Force staff. 27 March 2023The Trades Union Congress attacks an “appalling decision” to allow DP World to co-run the Thames Freeport in Essex, as part of the Tory government’s freeports plan. It is reported the project will see more than £4.6bn in investment, with the creation of 21,000 jobs. 9 October 2024Transport secretary Louise Haigh promotes a new employment rights bill on TV, urging viewers to join her in boycotting P&O Ferries. Deputy PMAngela Rayneris quoted in a press release the next day saying the sackings were “an outrageous example of manipulation by an employer”. 11 October 2024DP World pulls out of a £1bn investment at London Gateway, part of the Thames Freeport, due to be announced at the government’s investment summit tomorrow, according to reports. 12 October 2024It is reported that DP World would attend the investment summit.

Body parts in freezer left at Colorado home spark homicide investigation,,"Body parts found in a freezer that was left behind at aColoradohome that was sold are of a 16-year-old girl who went missing in 2005, authorities have said. The death of Amanda Leariel Overstreet – the biological daughter of the home’s previous owner – is being investigated as a homicide, according to the sheriff’s office overseeing the case. An investigation into Overstreet’s slaying remains ongoing. The discovery of Overstreet’s remains was made in January, after the new owner of a house near Grand Junction gave away a freezer left behind by the previous occupant. The person who claimed the freezer found a human head and forearms with hands attached,saidthe Mesa county sheriff’s office. Overstreet’s body parts were identified through DNA testing. She had not been seen since April 2005, and “there is no record that Amanda Overstreet was ever reported missing”, a statement from the sheriff read. An exact cause of death has not yet been determined, and no arrests have been made. The missing girl lived in the Grand Junction and Harris county, Texas, areas, according to the Mesa county coroner’s office. The new owner of the home was “completely unrelated to the previous case”, said the sheriff’s office. “The house was purchased, fully remodeled, and sold to the current owner.” According toColorado Public Radio, records show a home on the street where Overstreet’s remains were discovered belonged to a Bradley David Imer, who died of Covid-19 in 2021. The outlet said Imer’s death certificate lists his spouse as Leanne Overstreet. Colorado Public Radio noted that it had been unable to determine whether Leanne Overstreet and Amanda Overstreet were related. But the sheriff’s office did confirm to the outlet that Amanda’s biological mother had been a previous owner of the home where the remains were found. Meanwhile, the Mesa county sheriff’s office provided a statement to theDaily Mailconfirming Leanne Overstreet had indeed owned the home where her daughter’s remains were found.",Oliver Milman,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/oliver-milman,2024-10-12,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/colorado-freezer-body-part-homicide-investigation
More than fat bears: Alaska trail cams show peeks of animals from lynx to moose,,"Millions of people worldwide tuned in for a remoteAlaskanational park’s “Fat Bear Week” celebration this month, as captivating livestream camera footage caught the chubby predators chomping on salmon and fattening up for the winter. But in the vast state known for its abundant wildlife, the magical and sometimes violent world of wild animals can be found close to home. Within half a mile of a well-populated neighborhood in Anchorage, the state’s biggest city, several trail cameras regularly capture animals ranging in size from wolverines to moose. A Facebook group that features the animals caught on webcams has seen its number of followers grow nearly sixfold since September, when it posted footage of a wolf pack taking down a moose yearling. But it’s not all doom-and-gloom videos on the page, and the actual death of the moose calf was not shown. The group, named Muldoon Area Trail Photos and Videos, also features light-hearted moments such as two brown bear cubs standing on their hind legs and enthusiastically rubbing their backs against either side of a tree to mark it. Ten cameras capture lynx, wolves, foxes, coyotes, eagles and black and brown bears – “just whatever is out here”, said Donna Gail Shaw, a co-administrator of the Facebook group. In addition to the 290,000 or so human residents of Anchorage, nearly 350 black bears, 65 brown bears and 1,600 moose call it home. Joe Cantil, a retired tribal health worker, said the idea for the page started when he was looking down at vast open lands from an airplane on a hunting trip near Fairbanks. “You’re out in the middle of nowhere, so you see animals acting however they act whenever we’re not around,” he said. He later met wildlife officials in the Anchorage park conducting an inventory of predators. He saw them set up a trap and three webcams where a moose had been killed. “When I saw that, I thought: ‘Yeah, I can do that,’” he said. Cantil set up a low-tech camera, and caught his first animal on it, a wolverine, fueling a passion that led to the creation of the Facebook page in 2017. Then, while hiking, he met Shaw, a retired science education professor and associate dean of the education school at the University of Alaska Anchorage. Shaw was intrigued by his game cameras and began bugging him to see the footage. “Well, he finally got tired of me pestering him, and one day, he said: ‘You know, you can get your own camera,’ and so that started my hobby,” said Shaw, a native of Texas. She started by strapping a single $60 camera to a tree. Now she has nine cameras, seven of which are active in Far North Bicentennial Park, a 4,000-acre (1,619-hectare) park stretching for miles along the front range of the Chugach mountains on the east side of Anchorage. Her cameras are set up anywhere between a quarter-mile to a half-mile (402 meters to 804 meters) of the Chugach Foothills neighborhood, and she frequently posts to the Facebook group page. Cantil also posts videos from his three cameras. “I knew there was wildlife out here because I would occasionally run into a moose or a bear on the trail, but I didn’t know how much wildlife was out here until I put the cameras on it,” Shaw said. She replaces batteries and storage cards about once a week, walking into the woods to do so armed with an air horn to announce her presence, two cans of bear spray and a .44-caliber handgun for protection. Many of the page’s followers are Anchorage residents looking for information about which animals may currently be roaming around the popular trail system. Other users join to see what the cameras capture, and included people from other states who “enjoy looking at the wildlife that we have here”, she said. Shaw said that every few years, her cameras catch a wolf or two – and sometimes even a pack. This year, she was surprised when a pack of five wolves came by, walking quietly in a single file. Last month, while she collected memory cards, she saw moose fur on the ground across the creek from two of her cameras. After she spotted what looked like a roughed-up patch of dirt where a bear might bury its kill, she assumed it was another moose, attacked by a black bear, similar to what had happened earlier not too far away. But when she checked the memory card, it instead showed the wolves taking down the moose yearling as the moose’s mother attempted to protect her offspring by trying to kick the wolves away with her long legs. Now, the demand for the page is growing, but Shaw said she’s done adding cameras. “I think I’m at my camera max,” she said. “Nine is enough!”",,,2024-10-12,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/bears-wolves-moose-alaska-trail-cams

Floridians returning home after Milton battle traffic jams and fuel shortages,,"Thousands of people who fled the onrushingHurricane Miltonare facing fuel shortages, debris and long traffic jams as they return to damaged Florida communities that are confronted with lengthy rebuilds. Millions of people were urged to evacuate before Milton, which slammed into western Florida on Wednesday as a category 3 hurricane, causing more than a dozen deaths, ruined homes and flooding and triggering a rash of destructive tornadoes. More than 1.5 million people are still without power in the wake of the storm. Many of those who did evacuate have been trying to make their way back home but face difficulties in doing so, with traffic snarled back into the Tampa Bay area. Fuel shortages are also gripping the state, with lengthy waits for gasoline facing those seeking to head home. Florida has set up three fuel distribution sites – in Bradenton, Plant City and St Petersburg – where residents can each get 10 gallons of gasoline for free, and is planning to set up more. “Obviously, as power gets restored, maybe some of them have generators that they can get on, and when the Port of Tampa’s open, you’re going to see the fuel flowing,” said Florida governor Ron DeSantis. “But in the meantime, we want to give people another option.” DeSantis said the state plans to open additional locations in Tampa and in Pinellas county, and at least one in Sarasota, with perhaps more depending on the demand. Officials have said that an unusual number of people evacuated before Milton’s landfall, heeding dire warmings about the potential impact of the storm, which at one point had strengthened into a category 5 event. Milton hit coastal communities just two weeks after they were damaged by Hurricane Helene. Scientists have said that both storms were made stronger, and provided extra rainfall, by the climate crisis, due to an unusually hot Gulf of Mexico. In the seaside town of Punta Gorda, Mayor Lynne Matthews said rescuers only had to save three people from floodwaters after Milton passed, compared with 121 rescues from Helene’s flooding. “So people listened to the evacuation order,” Matthews told a news conference on Friday, noting that local authorities ensured residents heard them. “We had teams out with the megaphones going through all of our mobile home communities and other places to let people know that they needed to evacuate.” Many of those who have made it home face a long recovery as they pick through their properties alongside clean-up crews. “Paradise is still paradise, despite this mess,” said Pat Hurst, who along with her husband, Bill, has lived on Siesta Key, a barrier island near Tampa, since 2011 and has been visiting for more than two decades. “That said, cleaning up from one hurricane while trying to prepare for another was really stressful.” Joe Biden is planning to visit affected communities in Florida on Sunday, where he is expected to again call for Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House, to recall Congress to provide further aid for disaster recovery. Johnson has so far refused to do so. DeSantis, Florida’s governor, has said that he has been satisfied so far with the federal support for his state. “He basically said, you know, you guys are doing a great job. We’re here for you,” he said when asked about his conversations with Biden. “We sent a big request and we got approved for what we wanted.”",Oliver Milman,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/oliver-milman,2024-10-12,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/florida-milton-traffic-jams-fuel-shortages-debris
Venezuela has cancelled passports of dozens of activists and journalists,,"The Venezuelan government has cancelled the passports of dozens of journalists and activists since PresidentNicolás Maduroclaimed a re-election victory, part of what rights groups said is an intensifying campaign of repression against the authoritarian president’s opponents, the Financial Times has reported. At least 40 people, mostly journalists and human rights activists, have had their passports annulled without explanation, the newspaper reported on Saturday, citing Caracas-based rights group Laboratorio de Paz. The group warned that the number of people who have had their passports cancelled is likely to be much higher due to Venezuelans’ fear of reporting cases, the FT said. Laboratorio de Paz could not be immediately reached about the report. People have had their passports confiscated by authorities while attempting to board flights from the country’s main airport, the newspaper said, citing the rights group. Unlike murder or torture, which have a higher political cost, the government has found that passport cancellation is an effective way of neutralising and muffling critical voices with minimal effort, the newspaper reported, citing Rafael Uzcátegui, co-director of the rights group. Maduro was proclaimed the winner of the South American nation’s disputed July vote by electoral and judicial authorities,a claim rejected as falseby the opposition.",,,2024-10-12,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/venezuela-has-cancelled-passports-of-dozens-of-activists-and-journalists
Enrico Berlinguer: the 1970s communist hero inspiring Italy’s youth – and the far right,,"Enrico Berlinguer was a giant of the Italian left in the 1970s and 80s, coming close to leading the Communist party into government through a “historic compromise” with the country’s Christian Democrats, and championing “Eurocommunism”, a liberal, anti-Stalinist version of Marxism that briefly swept the continent. But his death 40 years ago, and the collapse of Europe’s communist parties in the late 1980s, eclipsed Berlinguer’s legacy, and Italy has since moved across the political spectrum,electing the far-right Giorgia Melonias prime minister in 2022. Now Berlinguer is having a revival in popularity, including among rightwing figures, as a film about his life opens theRome film festivalnext week before an international release. Berlinguer – La Grande Ambizione(The Great Ambition) will take viewers through the historical events that marked his career, from challenging the dogma of the cold war, and narrowly escaping an attempt on his life in Bulgaria, to taking the Italian Communist party (PCI) to the brink of power in the 1970s and standing firm against the political terrorism that seethed inItalyduring that period. Andrea Segre, its 48-year-old director, described the biopic as “a journey through a piece of history that I did not live through and which I learned to understand”. This quest for knowledge about Berlinguer – who died on 11 June 1984 aged 62, four days after suffering a stroke while delivering a campaign speech – also spurred thousands of young Italians to visit exhibitions about his life held this year in Rome and Bologna. “Frankly, we didn’t think the exhibitions, and all the other initiatives we have been doing for the 40 years since his death, would attract so much attention, affection and esteem,” said Ugo Sposetti, a former PCI parliamentarian and president of the Enrico Berlinguer foundation. “There has been a swell of participation among young visitors. These people were around 25 or 26 years old, who perhaps only knew about him through family conversations.” Berlinguer was born in Sardinia in 1922, a few months before the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini seized power. He joined the PCI in 1943 and was arrested a year later for taking part in a protest to demand essentials for the working class, such as bread and sugar. Elected leader in 1972, Berlinguer pursued a more moderate line for the PCI. Championing a democratic route to socialism, he distanced the party from the influence of the Soviet Union and pitched it as a proponent of national unity. He was much loved at home – for his sincerity, humanity and for working in the interests of the country rather than for personal power. Internationally he was feared, by both the left and the right. During the 12 years he led the PCI, Berlinguer took the party to the peak of its success, reaching the so-called “historic compromise” with Aldo Moro, leader of the Christian Democrats and a five-time prime minister. The alliance pact was inspired by the overthrow of democracy in Chile in 1973, but never came to fruition as Moro was kidnapped and killed in 1978 by far-left terrorist group the Red Brigade, derailing the coalition government just as it was about to be formed. Support for the PCI dwindled after Berlinguer’s death, but his legacy has endured. For today’s leftwing supporters, this can partly be explained by a yearning for a good-quality, non-divisive leader with long-term vision. More intriguingly, Berlinguer is also admired by the right. Meloni, whoseBrothers of Italyparty has neofascist roots, caused a stir when she paid an impromptu visit to the Berlinguer exhibition in Rome one evening. After being given a tour by Sposetti and avidly listening to some of Berlinguer’s most powerful speeches, she left a message in the visitor book noting that his life had been a “political story” and that “politics is the only possible solution to problems”. Critics balked, with some ex-PCI members expressing relief that they had not bumped into her. But given that Giorgio Almirante – the founder of the neofascist Italian social movement, whose youth wing Meloni joined in the early 1990s – has paid his respects to his political adversary in the chapel of rest, her visit might not be so unusual. “It was perhaps a surprise to the least attentive,” said Sposetti, adding that he had good relations with Meloni despite their differing views. “Meloni grew up on bread, water and politics. She has a vision of [political] parties, of militancy, similar to what I had … but naturally she believes one thing, and I believe another.” Berlinguer was also praised by Ignazio La Russa – a Brothers of Italy co-founder who in 2018 wasfilmed showing off fascist memorabiliain his home – at a party convention during which La Russa was interviewed by journalist Bianca Berlinguer, the late communist leader’s daughter. Sposetti said these public displays of admiration were perhaps “opportunistic”. But Mario Ajello, a journalist and political commentator for the newspaperIl Messaggero, believes it is because Berlinguer was recognised as being a “morally impeccable” leader capable of uniting opposing forces. “There is also some nostalgia today for the old parties and when they functioned well, and when Italy functioned,” he said. “Berlinguer was a guarantor, not only of his party’s interest, but for the general interest.” He added: “As for the far right, they do it to show they have overcome ideological barriers – because if you were a great Italian, even if you were a communist, they can appreciate you.” Meloni was also invited by Rome’s centre-left mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, to the opening ceremony of theRome film festivalon 16 October. “This is normal, and a correct institutional relationship should never be lacking,” he said, adding that despite their political differences, he has “a good personal relationship” with Meloni. Berlinguer: The Great Ambition is in Italian cinemas from 31 October and will later be released internationally.",Angela Giuffrida,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/angela-giuffrida,2024-10-12,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/enrico-berlinguer-communism-hero-italy-youth-far-right-film
King Charles and royals fail to reveal official gifts for past four years – despite promise to do so,,"King Charles and his family have failed to reveal their official gifts for the past four years, despite previously promising to publish an annual list. Palace officials have blamed the pandemic, the change of reign, and then planning for last year’s coronation for their inability to publish details of the gifts received by members of the royal family. The royal family’s reticence follows controversy over acash-for-honours scandalinvolving the king’s main charitable foundation, which led to a police investigation that was dropped last year without a full explanation from either Scotland Yard or the Crown Prosecution Service. It also comes after revelations that Charles, when he was Prince of Wales, accepted £2.6min cash in bagsfrom a Qatari politician for another of his charities, the Prince of Wales’s Charitable Fund. The Duke of York also faced allegations that when he was a working royal he used official overseas trips to conduct private business deals. But unlike MPs, who have to register gifts, donations and hospitality, there is no public register of interests for members of the royal family. Instead, they act on the advice of their private secretaries in deciding what to declare. Annual gift listswere introduced after media criticism of attempts by the royal household to conceal the origin of lavish jewellery given to Queen Camilla by a Saudi royal in 2006 and worn by her on an official visit to the US in 2007. The last annual list, detailing official gifts received by all working members of the royal family in 2019, was published in April 2020 but since then there has been nothing, apart from the occasional description of an exchange of presents during a state visit or pictures when they are given gifts during an engagement. Over the years, the annual list has led to controversy, such as in 2012 when it emerged that the king of Bahrain and his country’s prime minister had given a “suite of jewels” to Prince Edward’s wife, Sophie, while facing criticism over human rights abuses. But many presents, including sensitive ones, were often concealed, even though official gifts are not the personal property of the royals and are in effect accepted on behalf of the nation. Saudi Arabia’s controversial crown prince Mohammed bin Salman gave the Duchess of Sussex a £500,000 pair of diamond chandelier earrings as a wedding present in 2018. In October that year Meghan wore them at a state banquet in Fiji only a few days after the crown prince was accused of ordering themurder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But when journalists asked where she got them, palace officials said they were “borrowed”. She wore them again that November at a Buckingham Palace dinner to celebrate the then Prince Charles’s 70th birthday. It was only in March 2021, shortly before the Duke and Duchess of Sussex gave a controversialtelevision interview to Oprah Winfrey, that their true provenance was leaked. The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, chose not to release a list of any gifts they had received at their wedding in 2011. Only a handful of official gifts received by Queen Elizabeth for her platinum jubilee in 2022 were disclosed and it is not clear what, if any, were given to King Charles andQueen Camillato mark their coronation. It was all very different back in 1947, when the then Princess Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten. An exhaustive list of gifts to the couple was published and more than 2,500 items went on show to the public. Charles ordered a formal review of the royal household’s policy on official gifts in 2003,after a scandalover staff selling unwanted presents. It resulted in clearer definitions as to what constitutes an official gift and a personal present. Official gifts are those received in connection with official duties or from businesses or individuals not personally known to the family member. They include gifts from dignitaries, such as other heads of state or elected representatives, during events and are not the family members’ private property. Personal gifts are those from people they know privately with no connection to official duties. Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state to replace the monarch, said: “It is vital that the public knows about any possible conflicts of interest or attempts to curry favour with royals, as they have direct access to the highest levels of government.” He added: “Charles and senior royals have access to government papers, can have secretive meetings with ministers and the prime minister and they have leverage to pressure government to do favours for them and their friends. “The royals have form when it comes to blurring the lines between what’s theirs to keep and what’s an official gift. So full disclosure is needed on what’s been received and where those gifts are now. If we demand high standards from politicians, we must demand those same standards from the royals.” A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: “The royal gifts lists will be published in due course.”",,,2024-10-12,around-the-world,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/12/buckingham-palace-published-list-official-gifts-royal-family-king-charles

‘Photography is steeped in all kinds of colonial complexities’: Adam Ferguson’s outback Australia,,"From New York to Kabul, photojournalist Adam Ferguson made a career documenting other people’s countries. It led him back home, to capture a side of contemporary Australia you won’t see in Crocodile Dundee. When Ferguson started taking portraits around Australia in 2013, people would occasionally ask him where he was from. He grew up in Dubbo, but his years as a US-based photojournalist for the New Yorker, Time, National Geographic and the New York Times had apparently sanded the strine from his accent. He had been asking himself similar kinds of questions – about his place in the world, and the stories his camera captured. “I started to feel like I was quite disconnected as an expat living overseas,” Ferguson says. “At some point I felt like I had a bit of … a crisis might be dramatic, but I just started to lose my sense of identity.” Over the next decade he continued to venture further into the continent that was, on paper, his home. With camera in hand, Ferguson would travel from a “super pit” goldmine in Kalgoorlie, on Wangkatha Country, to the Broken Hill Correctional Centre, on Wilyakali Country, to the almond plantations of Robinvale, on Latje Latje Country. His “ultimate intention” was to “reframe, and make a contemporary portrait, of ‘the bush’ that I hadn’t seen before”, His new monograph, Big Sky, collects a decade of photography that Ferguson hopes disrupts the familiar and – at times – reductive representations of regional Australia seen across the political and media landscape. Ferguson’s medium format film camera lingers on a young cattle worker posing tentatively in front of a grove of pink bougainvillaea; a drag queen under a Hills Hoist preparing for a Priscilla: Queen of the Desert tribute show; and a pair of young Aboriginal women in Taylor Swift T-shirts looking out over Wadeye, in the Northern Territory. Many of Ferguson’s portraits invoke and subvert well-worn national iconography familiar from Wake in Fright to Baz Luhrmann’s Australia. “One of the things I’ve tried to do in my work is find archetypal Australian characters, like drovers, roo shooters, things that have been packed up in popular culture.” That led him to Billy Skinner, a drover who he first met in 2018, and kept running into. “He only ever called me ‘Kodak’, he’d never call me Adam,” Ferguson says. Watching men like Skinner at work, it occurred to Ferguson that a 21st-century drover’s life is a long way from Clancy of the Overflow. Today, their work is shaped by climate change, hired by farmers to move stock around to less drought-stricken feeding grounds. “Many of the farmers I encountered don’t believe in climate change, the vast majority,” Ferguson says. “But the reality is the modern iteration of the classic drover archetype isn’t moving cattle around for transport – it’s for weather patterns.” With Skinner’s Akubra cast to the ground, Ferguson’s 2022 shot of the denim-clad stockman tenderly holding his face to his horse’s neck subverts the archetype of a heroic horseman sitting high in the saddle. “He literally lives in a trailer on a stock route for the majority of the year, and lives with these horses and sleeps next to cattle. His whole existence comes from looking after cows, on the back of a horse, and occasionally a motorbike. I wanted to show the relationship to that horse, that kind of intimacy.” Ferguson was similarly drawn to the mythic figure of the sheep shearer, but his shirtless portraits of tattooed 30-year-old contract shearer Conan Wakefield and his 50-year-old father, George Smith, deliberately pushes back against the old romance of the shearing shed. “It didn’t matter what I did, it just felt like I was making an image that we’d already seen,” Ferguson says of his initial attempts to capture the men at work. “And that was beautiful, in a sense, [but] I wanted to veer away from that. Now, shearers are itinerant workers, and the industry’s nowhere as big as it used to be.” At times, Ferguson’s work documenting drought and bushfire saw him meet the challenges of climate change almost literally head-on. One of the more recent photographs was taken in Pyramul, on Wiradjuri Country, in 2023, of a burnt-out truck in a field still smoking from the fire that had just swept through. “Half an hour before I took that photo I watched the fire come down, me and the [Rural Fire Service] guys. There was only one road in and out, and we had to gather in a paddock and get ready to watch a fire front rip through us. Everyone got really nervous, and we were all there bracing for it. Then, at the last minute, the wind had changed, and it moved north.” Conscious that he was far from the first white man with a camera to document the continent’s interior, Ferguson also took care to give his subjects agency and avoid reinforcing stereotypes or tropes – including gaining approval from elders for images depicting First Nations communities. “The very process of photography is steeped in all kinds of colonial complexities. The thing that I really tried to do is make images that empower people, or depicted people in a way that gave us dignity and agency.” One striking image sees Pastor Simon Dixon, a Pintupi-Luritja and Lutheran priest, standing arms outstretched in front of the rolling hills of Ikuntji/Haast Bluff, Arrernte Country, the colours straight out of an Albert Namatjira watercolour. Ferguson had met the pastor months earlier, and envisioned taking his portrait out on Country in the vestments of a coloniser’s religion. But the pastor had other plans first. “I sat after church service in the morning, slept in my Land Cruiser for most of the day, because the light was crap and I knew I wanted to do it in afternoon light. And then, at the time we decided to shoot, Pastor Simon comes out and says, ‘Oh, we’re going hunting’. “So I jumped in the car with him and a few of these fellas, and we went hunting. We got back half an hour before sundown, and he was like, ‘Let’s do it’.” After a frantic 20-minute drive, Pastor Simon had led Ferguson to the perfect spot with moments of light left. “The sun went away and I was like, ‘Hopefully I got it’,” Ferguson says, in an accent that is, once again, unmistakably Australian. The final portrait is a poignant lesson in having a bit of faith. But, like the rest of Ferguson’s work, it’s a complicated picture.",Walter Marsh,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/walter-marsh,,multimedia,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/oct/12/photography-is-steeped-in-all-kinds-of-colonial-complexities-adam-fergusons-outback-australia
‘Children like these are in a battle for their livelihood’: Ziaul Huque’s best phone picture,,"The word Ziaul Huque uses to describe the recent deadly violence against student protesters in his country of Bangladesh is “despicable”. “In the end, the government could not survive by resorting to violence,” says Huque, who was once a university student himself. “History has repeatedly shown that no government can survive for long against a radical movement of students.” How quickly that political change can translate into solutions for the country’s many social and environmental problems remains to be seen, though. Huque, a freelance photographer, took this image on an iPhone 13 Pro Max at South Surma dumping site, in Sylhet. The garbage of the Sylhet City Corporation is brought here on a daily basis. “At an age when they should be heading off with a school bag on their shoulder, children like these are instead involved in a battle for their livelihood,” says Huque, who has an eight-month-old son. “Many people lost their homes in recent years due to frequent Covid outbreaks, floods, river erosion and other calamities, and they were forced to resettle in the city in search of a better future. Now they earn their living by filling plastic bags at the yard with bottles and selling them to factories in the city.” There’s no knowing where the parents of these children are, Huque adds. On the day he visited, the children had finished collecting their bottles and gathered together for a game of football with friends. “For a moment,” Huque says, “they were happy.”",Grace Holliday,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/grace-holliday,,multimedia,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/12/children-like-these-are-in-a-battle-for-their-livelihood-ziaul-huques-best-phone-picture

UFO 50 review – a galaxy of 80s games brought brilliantly back to the future,,"When he was a schoolboy, Derek Yu, one of the first indie game superstars of the 2000s, designed games on graph paper with his friend Jon Perry. After Yu’s first major game,Spelunky, became a hit, he and Perry agreed to collaborate again, no longer as classmates but as men in their 40s. This sweet backstory infusesUFO 50, a dizzyingly ambitious collection of 50 games that, so the narrative framing goes, were created by a fictional games company during the eight-year period from 1982 to 1989. Each game has the aesthetic of an Atari 2600 or NES classic – chunky sprites, a warbling chiptune soundtrack – but uses current design trends and understanding to inject old-looking games with modern freshness. Why 50? Who knows. But it’s a sufficiently high number that Yu and Perry (and some supportive developer friends) have been able to flex their design talent across an electrifying range of genres, some of which are familiar, others of which are entirely new. For example, inParty House, we must attempt to throw the best house party by achieving the perfect balance of guests, from vivacious but troublemaking rock stars, to pettable dogs, to comedians who bring the laughter at a financial cost. You’re scored on the quality of the evening you arrange, with penalties if the neighbours complain or the fire department decides your party has become hazardously peopled. Others attempt to perfect games of the era:Night Manoris a point-and-click horror story in which you’re pursued through a mansion;Bushido Ballan Edo-era themed version ofPong;Rail Heista kinetic stealth-action game in which you play as an outlaw and his horse staging a series of train heists. For Yu and Perry, it’s been a preposterously ambitious undertaking, multiplying the challenges and timings involved in crafting a single video game by a factor of 50. For us, the result is a gift of wild generosity, a demonstration of how much untapped creative terrain remains in even the crudest-looking video games.",Simon Parkin,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simon-parkin,,multimedia,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/12/ufo-50-games-review-80s-spelunky-mossmouth

Future-proofed practices: how upskilling is helping advisers do more with less,,"AtMAD Wealth, MAD stands for “making a difference”. This acronym is an ethos that drives the Australian purpose-driven accounting firm’s mission to give back and help clients measure the positive effect they are having on the world. “We aim to transform traditional accounting services into a vehicle for greater societal impact,” says the firm’s co-founder Amar Latif. To make this vision a reality, Latif is upskilling in emerging areas of advisory. He’s part of a growing group of progressive accountants and bookkeepers who are prioritising professional development, while future-proofing their practices along the way. Providing development opportunities has helped practice owners such as Latif attract and retain talent in a tight labour market; 40% of firms surveyed for Xero’s2023 State of the industryreport said they were appealing to potential new hires by offering benefits such as upskilling and training. MAD Wealth has used learning platforms such asTaxBanterandKnowledge Shop, which offer tax and business advisory training. Beyond this, Latif says he’s also invested in specialised courses in carbon accounting and environmental sustainability. The former is a way for businesses to track the amount of greenhouse gases they emit, acting as a ledger for climate impact that sits alongside regular financial reporting. It’s a skill that’s keeping MAD Wealth ahead of the curve; the Xero report found that 18% of practices offer sustainability reporting consulting. Some of the other courses Latif and his team have completed include advanced tax law and digital accounting solutions. “Keeping across the latest tax regulations and digital tools, including those offered by Xero, ensures we can optimise our clients’ financial strategies and operational efficiencies,” he says. Hot Toastis another advisory firm that uses education to drive practice performance. Sarah Lawrance is Hot Toast’s director and primary consultant. She says the firm holds a unique position in the accounting and advisory market, specialising in support for growing creative, digital, startup and real estate businesses. The practice has always been proactive and innovative, which has helped drive its success along the way. “We knew that early on education and learning was the cornerstone of that,” she says. Lawrance sees the widespread adoption of AI-powered technologies as a huge opportunity for accounting and bookkeeping firms. She has spent the past six months exploring the potential of AI in her practice, hiring developers, and bringing her team on the journey, from formal courses in machine learning to self-directed experimentation. “I get a kick out of learning about AI because it’s back-to-basics numbers and maths,” she says. Lawrance says these new skills have allowed her to make more informed business decisions. “I have limited resources, so I need the best return on investment when I’m looking at cashflow or resource allocation. AI can help me do that.” Lawrance’s newly gained knowledge has allowed her to apply AI to her firm’s workflows to boost efficiencies. “We’ve taken every process at a transaction, bookkeeping and tax level and built AI processes around them. All of a sudden, there are fewer errors and things get done quickly.” Integrating automation has augmented Hot Toast’s services, meaning the business is able to do more with less. “When you’re a smaller business competing with bigger businesses, you have to be smart and agile, make decisions and fail fast quickly, and I’m using AI to achieve this,” Lawrance says. A key finding from Xero’s report reveals that small businesses are increasingly relying on advisory firms for support beyond traditional accounting and compliance. In particular, practices said they were providing more expanded offerings in areas such as app/software setup (34%) HR advisory (30%), startup mentoring/business development (26%), and advice on capital raising (22%). This creates opportunities for accountants and bookkeepers to not only level up their skills in emerging areas, but also build better relationships with their clients and provide higher-value holistic services. Latif says staying focused on upskilling means he can offer clients services that move beyond historical reporting and focus more on their goals and purpose. “We build close relationships with clients and become their go-to resource for strategic decision-making and problem-solving,” he says. “This ensures we - MAD Wealth – can effectively partner with clients as trusted advisers, helping them unlock the good in their businesses and make a difference in the world.” Tax time is better off on Xero.

Cancer treatments can produce lots of mental and physical side-effects, one of which is skin irritations, which canaffect more than 80%of patients. La Roche-Posay has led studies on more than 11,000 cancer patients, and its new initiative aims to raise awareness about the dermatological side-effects of cancer treatments – the itching, burning, scars and acute dryness that can occur – while educating healthcare professionals, patients and loved ones about relief methods for the skin before, during and after treatments. Founded in a French town of the same name in 1975 (home to a thermal spring from which the company sources water for its products), La Roche-Posay develops skincare products for the most sensitive skin types. In 2008 the company began exploring the effects of cancer treatments on the skin, and formed an advisory board of oncologists and dermatologists that developed recommendations on how to manage cutaneous toxicities with dermocosmetic solutions – with the aim of improving cancer patients’ quality of life. Now the brand has produced a comprehensive patient support guide that helps people care for their skin when fighting cancer. Questions a patient might have on this subject are answered by experts: How do I moisturise and protect my skin? How do I respond to my itchy and dry skin? How do I deal with an inflamed hair follicle? What should I do before and after my radiotherapy session? How do I take care of my scars? How do I best apply makeup? La Roche-Posay also offers afree, 15-minute online training sessionfor patients and caregivers, covering four components of supportive care: mental health; hair, skin and nails; mouth, stomach and nutrition; and pain and fatigue. In addition, La Roche-Posay has recently announced it will commit significant funding to the Princess Alexandra Research Foundation in Queensland to create an onco-dermatology clinic, which will allow oncology patients experiencing skin impacts to have direct access to specialised dermatological care through the hospital. Professor Kiarash Khosrotehrani, the director of dermatology at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, says: “Over three-quarters of cancer patients grapple with severe skin side-effects resulting from treatment. The severity of these side-effects can even compel patients to halt or delay their therapy, even though these consequences can be mitigated by implementing straightforward skincare protocols, such as cleansing, moisturising, sun protecting and using protective products. “There is more that can be done to support cancer patients in achieving skin comfort, and that’s why La Roche-Posay’sFight With Carecampaign is so important.” Through advisory boards, the skincare brand also identified nurses’ critical roles in oncology patient support. This insight inspired a partnership with the breast cancer support charity the McGrath Foundation. The three-year collaboration will see La Roche-Posay sponsor an oncology nurse in the community, supporting women undergoing treatment. A person diagnosed with cancer is in the fight of their life, and according to research conducted by La Roche-Posay, 80% of cancer patients say supportive care is as important as treatments. If cancer patients can find relief from their skin reactions, have educated loved ones and professionals around them (and maybe enjoy a hot chocolate from their local gardening store every so often), they might have a more comfortable experience.

What it really means to fight cancer with care: inside the McGrath Foundation’s partnership with La Roche-Posay,,"On May 12 we celebrate International Nurses Day, but the power of a nurse’s care is felt everyday.In her decade-long career as an oncology nurse, Gurpreet Grewal vividly remembers the day one of her young patients called her and was “very upset”. “Due to the adverse effects many anti-cancer therapies can have on the skin, this patient was struggling with pain – namely on her hands and feet – and could not do simple tasks such as doing up zippers or buttons,” Grewal says. “Her fingertips and heels were cracking.” Along with a medical team, Grewal, a McGrath Foundation metastatic breast care nurse at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne, flung into gear. “The first thing we did was give the patient a break from treatment,” Grewal says. “Next, I spent time educating her on why this occurred and how to manage it. We discussed many strategies, such as the importance of moisturising, skin protection and wearing gloves when washing dishes. Once the skin was healed, we recommenced treatment and continued these new strategies to proactively prevent and manage adverse skin effects.” Many people going through cancer treatments experience adverse skin side-effects; itching, burning, scars, severe dryness, the list goes on. Grewal’s appointment at the McGrath Foundation is made possible by skincare brand La Roche-Posay, which has been studying the skin impacts of cancer treatments for 15 years. As a part of its Fight With Care initiative, the brand has struck a three-year partnership with the McGrath Foundation and will sponsor Grewal as she continues her vital role in oncology care in the community. The McGrath Foundation’s CEO, Holly Masters, says: “When you’re diagnosed with cancer, it feels like your world has imploded. Suddenly, you’re bombarded with lots of new language, you don’t know which way to turn, or what information to trust. What a McGrath nurse does is enable you to take one day at a time and make really good decisions based on what is right for you, and what is right for your family, in order to ensure you can be the person that you want to be during what really is a traumatic time. “A nurse can provide very tailored support – emotional, psychological, psychosocial and physical help – all the way from the day of diagnosis through to treatment. It’s that bespoke level of care that genuinely makes a difference.” La Roche-Posay was founded in 1975 in the French town of the same name. In 2008, the company began focusing on the effects of cancer treatments on the skin. It formed an advisory board of oncologists and dermatologists who reviewed updated scientific data to develop suitable dermocosmetic solutions – with the aim of helping to improve quality of life for those undergoing cancer treatment. “The reality is most patients have skin reactions,” Masters says. “I’ve heard of people who did not want to walk out of their front door because of the way they felt they looked. One of the things that we hear very often is if they look normal, they feel much more confident about going outside and living a normal life. “If you have something that signifies you’re sick – whether it is losing your hair or having reactions and your skin being really impacted – that’s a signal for somebody else to say, ‘Goodness, are you OK?’ And as someone going through treatment, you are having to have that conversation all the time.” La Roche-Posay joined the McGrath Foundation as a nurse partner in June 2023, a move for which Masters is incredibly grateful. The support charity has 204 breast care nurses, and aims to have 250 by 2025. “The partnership means the world to us here at the foundation,” Masters says. “It allowed us to bring on board Gurpreet, who is one of our amazing nurses. Gurpreet works with people who have advanced cancer and effectively they have much greater complexities in their lives because they don’t just have tumours in their breast. “Gurpreet is an incredible nurse and without the support of La Roche-Posay – there is such an integrity in the work that the skincare company is doing – we wouldn’t be able to have Gurpreet supporting so many people.” Grewal says: “I am available via phone, email, text message and face to face. I am there when people are first diagnosed and continue to support them throughout their entire cancer experience. A consistent point of contact, a familiar face in a time of uncertainty and complicated healthcare systems.” Now that is fighting with care.

"Hanif Kureishi on his accident: ‘I believed I was dying, that I had three breaths left. It seemed like a miserable and ignoble way to go’",,"On Boxing Day, in Rome, after taking a walk to the Piazza del Popolo, followed by a stroll through the Villa Borghese, then back to the apartment, I had a fall. Sitting at a table in Isabella’s living room with my iPad in front of me, I had just seen Mo Salah score against Aston Villa. I was sipping a beer when I began to feel dizzy. I leant forward and put my head between my legs; I woke up a few minutes later in a pool of blood, my neck in a grotesquely twisted position, Isabella on her knees beside me. I then experienced what can only be described as a scooped, semicircular object with talons scuttling towards me. Using what was left of my reason, I saw this was one of my hands, an uncanny thing over which I had no agency. It occurred to me that there was no coordination between my mind and what remained of my body. I had become divorced from myself. I believed I was dying, that I had three breaths left. It seemed like a miserable and ignoble way to go. People say when you’re about to die your life passes before your eyes, but for me it wasn’t the past but the future that I thought ­about – everything I was being robbed of, all the things I wanted to do. Isabella and I live in London but we were staying in her apartment in Rome for Christmas, and it was there that I had my fall, sitting at the large round table, covered in books and papers, where she and I work together in the mornings. From the bathroom, she heard my frantic shout, came in and called an ambulance. She saved my life and kept me calm, crouching down beside me. I told her I wanted to FaceTime my three sons and say goodbye, but Isabella said it wasn’t a good idea, it would frighten and appal them. For a few days I was profoundly traumatised, altered and unrecognisable to myself. Now I am in the Gemelli hospital, Rome. I cannot move my arms and legs. I cannot scratch my nose, make a phone call or feed myself. As you can imagine, this is both humiliating and degrading, making me a burden for others. According to my hospital report, my fall resulted in neck hyperextension and immediate tetraplegia. An MRI scan showed a severe stenosis of the vertebral canal with signs of spinal cord injury from C3 to C5. In layman’s terms, the vertebrae at the top of my spine suffered a kind of whiplash. I’ve had an operation on my neck to relieve compression on my spine where the injury is, and have shown minor motor improvements. I have sensation and some movement in all my limbs, I did not have what they call a “complete break”. I will begin physio and rehabilitation as soon as possible. At the moment, it is unclear whether I will be able to walk again, or if I’ll ever be able to hold a pen. I am speaking these words through Isabella, who is slowly typing them into her iPad. I am determined to keep writing, it has never mattered to me more. I wasn’t a happy child but I wasn’t an unhappy one either. Once I could read I was free. I could go to libraries every day, often accompanied by my mother, and I saw that books were a way out of my immediate surroundings. Soon I learned to cycle. Alone, I could explore the streets and fields of the countrified ­semi-­suburbs in which I grew up. It was a county called Kent, which had been bombed to hell not long before I was born. In those days parents were less police­-­like. They gave you a penny at the beginning of the day and didn’t expect to see you until the evening. I cycled all day, stopped where I wanted and talked to anyone who had a story for me. I am still like that. The third element in my liberation was the discovery of my father’s typing manual. My father himself had been a journalist and was writing fiction. His vigorous typing in his sexy shirtsleeves seemed impressive. One day he bought a little portable typewriter in a blue case of which he was incredibly proud. I started to blindfold myself with my school tie and found I could type the correct words in order without looking. It was exhilarating. I had been reading Crime and Punishment at the time, always a cheery go-to book for a young man, and as practice I began to copy out pages from this great novel. At school I had been a disaster, but at last I had found something I could do. I never had the desire to write underwater stories, adventure stories or amazing tales involving giants, dwarfs, elves or mermaids. I didn’t know much about those things, but I did know the people around me. And I guess that made me into something of a realist. One day, looking out of the window at school, I called myself a writer. I found the title suited me like a good shirt. I was keen for others to apply the word to me even though I hadn’t yet written anything. After all, at school many words had already been applied to me, words like “Brownie”, or “Paki”, or “Shit-­face”, so I found my own word, I stuck to it, and never let it go. It is still my word. Excuse me for a moment, I must have an enema now. The last time a medical digit entered my backside was a few years ago. As the nurse flipped me over she asked, “How long did it take you to write Midnight’s Children ?” I replied, “If I had indeed written that, don’t you think I would have gone private?” My hands continue to feel like alien objects. They’re swollen, I cannot open or close them, and when they are under the sheets, I could not tell you where they are precisely. They may in fact be in another building altogether, having a drink with friends. I have been moved from the ICU to a small grim side room. There is a picture of the Virgin Mary ahead of me, and the view outside the window, which I cannot see myself, is of a car park, motorway, and Roman pine trees, which look like parasols. I tell Isabella the place hasn’t been decorated since Hemingway left. I was low yesterday. Trying to dictate these words to Isabella, I became impatient with the slowness of the process. She is Italian and English is her second language, so she doesn’t always get what I say. Carlo Kureishi, one of my twin sons, has now flown out to Italy, and is helping me with this dictation. He is in his late 20s and, like me, read philosophy at university. He enjoys movies and sport and is starting to make his way as a screenwriter. What I like about him is that he can type quickly. Normally, of course, I can write this stuff up myself. I can even spell. Isabella and I have started to argue. She is in the hospital with me all day, and is looking tired and thin, as she would in the circumstance of this terrible strain. When she turned to me and asked, “Would you have ever done this for me?” I couldn’t answer. I don’t know. Our relationship has taken a new turn, not one we could have anticipated, and we will have to find a new way of loving each other. At the moment, I have no idea how to do this. In this somewhat desolate Roman hospital, in a suburb of Rome, I am writing these words to try to reach someone, and I am, at the same time, attempting to connect with Isabella, to make a new relationship out of an old one. You’d think I’d have enough on my plate. I wish what had happened to me had never happened, but there isn’t a family on the planet that will evade disaster. But out of these unexpected breaks, there must be new opportunities for creativity. I sat up today. I sat up today after eight days on my back. Four physiotherapists came to my room. They started to move me with the determination of sitting me up. They turned me, and for a moment I sat on the bed, with my feet on the floor, staring ahead of me. I have to say, I felt proud and amazed and incredibly dizzy. Sign up toInside Saturday The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I slump. I used to choose my shirts carefully, in colours I thought suited me. I moved lightly as I swung around my city. Now I can’t even do up my own buttons. I can wiggle my toes and move my feet up and down. My left foot is stronger than my right, from which there is less response. I can straighten and bend my left leg, but there is minimal movement in my right. I can move my arse and even jerk it about. As for the surface of my skin, I am a little numb below the waist, but I have sensibility all the way down. I am not in a neck brace and do not have the petrified look paralysed people can have. I am able to move my neck and shoulders, and can move my right arm and hold up my right hand a little, but it is weak at the wrist and hangs limply down. I can’t close or open my fingers. As far as I can tell, my brain is unaffected, and I can think as I did before. Two of my sons, Kier and Sachin, have come to Rome and seen me for the first time in this state. They were shocked, we all cried a little, but they tried to remain upbeat and humorous. No one knows whether or how I will progress, so it is difficult to predict what the future will look like for us as a family. At last, not such a bad night. Asleep at nine and, excluding a few interruptions, I was unconscious until five. The previous evening I had asked for more sleeping aids but was told they had run out. Perhaps I had already consumed the hospital’s supply. But last night was better. Having not left this room for nine days I seem to be adjusting to my condition, unfortunately. At six thirty in the morning, to the sound of crashing buckets and loud voices, the nurses came to wash and change me. They lift you up in a blanket, roll you around and scrub you. They wash your genitals and your arse, often while singing jolly Italian songs. One of the male nurses is particularly fond of Bruce Springsteen and likes to sing along to Dancing in the Dark. I don’t mind so much, I enjoy the company. Next up is breakfast, a bowl of dirty cold tea in which a sugary biscuit is dumped. They spoon it into my mouth. It’s then my physios come. They are determined to get me upright. This involves strapping me into a blue sling with my feet on the floor and standing me up vertically. I have to say this is a horrible experience since I have not been upright for some time. The world seems at the wrong angle, everything in the incorrect place and the colours flying around, unattached to specific objects, like hallucinations. I couldn’t breathe and thought I might vomit. They laid me down again and said it would take some time to get used to standing up. My next adventure involves being placed on a trolley and dragged on my back for miles around the hospital for various tests. I begin to figure out where I am from the position of the ceiling tiles. Two weeks ago a bomb went off in my life which has also shattered the lives of those around me. My partner, my children, my friends. All my relationships are being renegotiated. It makes everybody a little crazy, it changes everything. There is guilt and rage, and people resent their dependence on one another. My accident was a physical tragedy, but the emotional outcomes for all of us are going to be significant. I’m proud to be dependent on others who love me. And so far they appear to want to come to my aid. I’ve had lots of kind offers from friends and strangers suggesting expensive and useful things to help me continue writing. It should go without saying that I am profoundly moved and grateful. I’d like to add that I really enjoy writing these dispatches from my bed. At least I haven’t lost the one thing that was most valuable to me, which is my ability to express myself. Last night things got tense in this little room; Isabella was tired, if not exhausted, and there were some nasty conflicts between us. The issue of the cleaning of my teeth brought things to a head. Isabella is not a dentist. Using a toothbrush, some floss and a cocktail stick, she tried to clean my mouth as I was trying to dictate. I began to feel I was both a helpless baby and a terrible tyrant; to be in a position like this is to have to endure vulnerability and frustration. Last night, Isabella set up a film for me on my iPad before she left. I felt relaxed and was enjoying the movie when the cleaner came in, moved some things around and knocked the iPad on its back. She turned the light off and shut the door behind her. I was in almost complete darkness. I could still hear the film, however, and tried to work out what was happening from the silhouettes flickering on the ceiling, like a shadow puppet show. Sometime later I drifted into sleep and started to dream of my hands, which were tied together with a silver cord so I was unable to move them. For some reason I can’t explain, I also had a memory of being on the jury of the Cannes film festival in 2009 when Isabelle Huppert was the president. We jury members, who included Asia Argento and Robin Wright, used to sneak into films early in the morning to avoid the red-­carpet exhibition in the evening. It also meant we could leave early if the films were unpleasant, which they often were. But one film in particular stayed with me. It was Lars von Trier’s Antichrist, images from which pursued me last night. The best film from that year was Jacques Audiard’s A Prophet, which surely deserved to win first prize. I woke up and started to cry. When you cry you must wipe away your tears, which is something I’m unable to do. So my eyes filled with bitter salty water and I got into a panic and thought I might lose my eyesight along with everything else. Finally, a kind nurse came into my room and downed me with a good dose of Lorazepam, then she touched me on my cheek and said, “It’s not so bad, at least you’re not in a coma.” In the morning, feeling rather peckish, I was encouraged by the pleasant breakfast smells wafting in from the corridor. I was delighted to see, for the first time, an array of hot Italian pastries and cheeses, and some freshly squeezed orange juice. The nurses have to feed me. This particular one didn’t speak English and was apparently unaware of my requirements. The food sat there on my table temptingly for an hour before the nurse returned, shrugged, picked up the tray and asked, “You did not like?” before leaving with my breakfast. Tomorrow I will be leaving here. This is my last day in this little room, my temporary prison. I will be moved to a much larger six-­floor facility where they say I will receive ­high-­quality physiotherapy. It feels as if my body is turning into marshmallow, that I am deliquescing. I will also be able to meet others whose bodies are busted in different ways. A strange thing happened to me: I went to Rome with Isabella for a few days at Christmas and now I will never go home again. I have no home now, no centre. I am a stranger to myself. I don’t know who I am any more. Someone new is emerging. It is time for my second enema now. I am looking forward to it.

Gavin Grimm won a landmark victory for US trans youth. He now struggles to survive,,"Gavin Grimm, 25, and five of his close friends are crowded around a table, laughing and shouting over each other as they recount the bullies they survived as teenagers. Seated in the back of a strip mall pub in Newport News, a midsize city in south-easternVirginia, they recall the boys who spat on them at a pep rally and the time a popular senior threatened to beat up Grimm because he is transgender. “We were all misfits and leaned on each other,” says Calin Lindberg, one of Grimm’s oldest friends. “These people are part of my fucking soul,” Grimm adds. The group over-enunciates one bully’s name, joking he should be exposed. But they also express empathy for their tormentors – some later came out as queer and trans themselves. They direct more of their ire at the adults in their school system, who made Grimm’s life a living hell. In 2014, the Gloucester county school boardvotedto ban Grimm, then 15, from using the boys’ bathrooms, even though he’d been living openly as a boy for months and using the restroom without incident. The policy turned deeply intimate facts of Grimm’s life into a media spectacle. With the ACLU, hesuedto defend his rights to use facilities that matched his gender, launching a groundbreaking national case on bathroom access. Grimmbecamean LGBTQ+ icon,celebratedby Laverne Cox at the Grammys andinterviewedby Whoopi Goldberg on The View. He eventuallywona landmark federal decision asserting trans youth’s constitutional protections against discrimination. Advocates hoped the victory would squash the conservative movement’s targeting of trans students. Instead, the climate for trans youth in the US hasrapidly devolvedaslaws eroding their rightshave been adopted in more than half of the country in recent years. Trans students have increasingly been banned frombathroomsandsports teams, barred from using their pronouns and names, and their existence has been ridiculed by Republican leaders and debated in news segments. And while Grimm became a civil rightstrailblazer, the case did not secure him stability or financial security. The Pride parade invites have stopped coming, and like somanyother marginalized trans people, Grimm has faced significant mental health challenges and struggles with poverty. He recently lost his housing, and is now facing homelessness. “I’m someone who has had worldwide visibility. I represent an outer crust of privilege most people will never see, and I cannot make ends meet no matter how hard I try,” he says. Grimm had little confusion about who he was at a young age. He rejected girl’s clothes, wanted his hair short and legs unshaven and despised the Baptist teachings of his family’s church. He came out as lesbian at 13, but knew the label wasn’t right. Once he learned being trans was a possibility, “there was no questioning phase,” he recalls. “It was like seeing color for the first time.” His mother, Deirdre Grimm, knew nothing about trans identity, and vaguely understood it as a “sin”. But she read a book her son gave her, learning that affirming a trans kid can dramatically decrease their suicide risk. “That’s all I needed to know,” Deirdre says one morning in July, seated with her son in his apartment. She helped him choose his name and told the rest of the family before his 15th birthday party. Then she switched to an LGBTQ+-affirming church. “Some parents of trans kids talk about this period of ‘mourning the loss of their daughter’, but I never went through any of that. He just became so much happier. He was also the same person – the kid who went out to help the homeless, the kid who liked to donate his birthday money.” Much of his family rejected him, but many friends and teachers were supportive as he entered 10th grade as a boy and clearly more comfortable in his skin. He initially used a private nurse’s restroom, but it was inconveniently located; peers and staff noted his long bathroom breaks, leaving him alienated and humiliated. So the principal and guidance counselor agreed to let him use the boys’ restroom, and for two months, he had no issues. But gossip circulated outside school and on a community Facebook forum, where people posted vicious comments. Friends defending him online faced harassment. “It was the adults who made it a problem, because their mentality spread to their kids,” recalls Evelyn Hronec, another friend. “These were grown adults talking about a 16-year-old’s genitals. It was vile.” At school board meetings in 2014, speakers stood feet away from Grimm, misgendering him, asking questions about his body and transition, calling him names and demanding he be kept out of boys’ facilities in the name of “safety”. In onespeech, Grimm pleaded for the opportunity to “use the restroom in peace”. When a mancalledhim a “freak” and likened him to an animal, Deirdre lunged out of her seat, she recalls. “I was fighting for his life.” Pursuing a lawsuit, Grimm says now, was a way to reclaim his story. “There was nothing to be lost by standing up for myself. People already didn’t like me or understand me. There already wasn’t a place for me in society. I realized I could choose to make one or slink away. I was either going to live as the boy I was – or not at all.” Grimm’s case progressed at a time of rapid change for LGBTQ+ rights. In 2015, the US supreme court legalized gay marriage and conservative groupsshifted focusto trans people, whipping up baseless fears about hypothetical “male predators” in women’s bathrooms. In 2016, North Carolina faced national scorn andcostly boycottsfor passing an anti-trans bathroom bill, which was later repealed. Grimm was a powerful antidote to the GOP’s dehumanizing messaging, says Joshua Block, the ACLU lawyer who represented him: “Gavin’s case really moved the conversation leaps and bounds forward for people’s understanding of trans people, the harms of discrimination and the inanity of these exclusionary policies.” AsDonald Trumprolled back LGBTQ+ rights, includingbanningtrans servicemembers from the military andauthorizinghomeless shelters to exclude trans people, Grimm won repeated court victories. But his school district appealed. One court of appealsjudgecompared Grimm to the historic American plaintiffs who challenged slavery, Japanese concentration camps, segregation and bans on interracial and gay marriage. A 2020 rulingoffereda “resounding yes” in favor of the constitution andcivil rights lawsprotecting trans students from discrimination. Grimm graduated before the case was resolved and never got to return to his school’s boys’ bathrooms. In 2021, the supreme courtallowedGrimm’s victory to stand, and the school board was ordered topay$1.3m in attorney’s fees. Grimm, however, only got a symbolic $1. To secure damages, Grimm would’ve had to give the opposition’s lawyers access to his medical records to scrutinize the cause and extent of his emotional distress, a process he couldn’t stomach after years of fighting. The idea he’d have to prove his anguish was unbelievable to his mom, who can’t shake the memories of her son becoming suicidal. Grimm doesn’t regret moving on without damages. But he desperately could’ve used financial help – especially as the trauma of his childhood began to catch up with him. Inside his Newport News apartment one hot day in July, Grimm sits under a poster he recently hung on his wall celebrating the 19th birthday of his belovedcat, Rascal, whose array of photos is captioned: “Doesn’t look a day over 12!” Grimm’s life revolves around Rascal, he explains: “If I maintain housing while my cat is still alive, that’s all I can really hope for. I’m prepared to face homelessness, but I just don’t want her to face it.” His struggle to stay afloat escalated as his case ended. The networks he’d built through the ACLU fight started to disappear, and his mental and physical health spiraled downward. Grimm has complex post-traumatic stress disorder and has suffered from stress-induced seizures that have affected his cognition and left him hospitalized in 2021. “The PTSD at its core is about not being safe or understood, being rejected, and the adults in my life not acting responsibly,” he explains. “In high school, I was picked over and hyper-analyzed. I was tortured, harassed and bullied.” He recalls a period when the stress was so severe he’d dissociate as he walked down the hallway, not hearing his friends call his name. Grimm also has autism and struggles with sensory processing, and the combined impacts of his disabilities have prevented him from holding down a job or completing school, he says. He’s relied on aGoFundMeand disability benefits, but has repeatedly struggled to make rent. His mother supports him but also has a tight income, he says. “I don’t have options … unless some rich gay philanthropist tosses me a crispy million.” At times, he’s felt disposable to the broader movement; he says it’s hard not to think of notable gay rights plaintiffs who have not struggled to make ends meet after their victories. “It makes me so angry that it’s so hard for him to find housing stability,” says Camille Gibson, his best friend who moved to England and video calls him on a nearly daily basis. “Some days, it’s almost like he’s short-circuiting because there’s just so much stress.” Still, the two find ways to have fun with each other from afar, often streaming anime. “When he’s not in a complete utter funk,” she says, “we are cackling at each other, because we’re both silly-billy stupid bitches.” Survey data hassuggestedmore than half of trans and nonbinary youth have considered suicide in the US, with increases in self-harmlinkedto anti-trans laws. Trans people disproportionately facehousing insecurityand related psychological distress. In August, Grimm put in his notice for his apartment, which he could no longer afford. His efforts to secure a voucher have so far been unsuccessful. And for the past month, he’s stayed where he can, sometimes with friends or his mother, who took in Rascal. He’s scared of homeless shelters, fearing discrimination. Some nights, he says, he finds himself sitting alone in a dog park. Despite the federal appeals court ruling in Grimm’s case that trans youth cannot be banned from bathrooms that match their gender, Virginia’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin,rolled out policieslast year directing schools to do exactly that, with limited exceptions. He is part of a wave of GOP lawmakers across the US who have, in the lead-up to the election, prioritized making it harder for trans youth toplay sports, getmedical care, have theirpronounsrespected, usepublic facilitiesand access LGBTQ+curriculum. Youngkin was yet another reminder of limits of the court process to secure meaningful progress, Grimm says. “Youngkin knows if he flies in the face of the law, the only possible repercussion is going to be some poor queer justice group will have to scrape together the money for another lawsuit,” Grimm says, noting that legal complaints carry the risk of increasingly conservative courts further eroding trans rights. “We’re going backwards after working so hard, after Gavin suffered so much,” says Deirdre, adding: “It makes me angry and sad, and makes me want to get everybody out to vote.” Grimm says he sees voting for Democrats as “harm reduction”, but he’s disillusioned with mainstream liberals who refuse to take bold, proactive steps to fight back against the GOP’s culture war. The Republican national convention was rife with cruelattacks on trans people. The Democratic convention, however, largelyavoidedthe topic of trans rights, and no trans person spoke. “This system is built specifically to ensure the status quo continues, that people like me are disenfranchised, underrepresented and never have full equality under the law,” Grimm says. “But I know that what I did was important. Even though the system is not going to serve our ultimate liberation, it is what we have in place right now.” These days, when he’s not working to resolve his housing, Grimm volunteers with a climate justice group. He hopes to eventually pursue teaching. He’s also worked to find queer community; in recent years, he’s befriended Evan Hamilton, a 66-year-old trans man he met through a local LGBTQ+ group. Seated in Hamilton’s garage, adorned with trans pride and weed flags, Grimm recalls their first meeting: “Evan said, ‘I’m an old man you won’t want to hang out with me.’ But we’re both autistic stoners who are trans, so we had a lot in common.” “I’m kind of like his grandpa, but I’ve learned a lot from him,” says Hamilton, who transitioned in 2018, more than five decades after he declared he was a boy at age six and was rebuffed by family. “I decided, screw ‘if’. I’m going to be who I’m supposed to be for what’s left of my life. I felt like I had released all this stuff that had weighed me down.” Grimm struggles to envision himself growing older, partly due to his personal crises and climate catastrophe, but also because of the “utter invisibility” of older trans men in media. His friendship with Hamilton has helped shift that. “I hope to get to the ripe old age of, ‘I don’t give a shit any more,’” says Grimm. “There’s a version of the future where I’m this older gentleman. This relationship shows there’s a whole lifespan waiting for me.”",Sam Levin,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sam-levin,,explore,https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2024/oct/12/gavin-grimm-trans-youth-rights
Woman who did not get leaving card loses UK employment claim,,"A woman who sued her former employer over not being given a leaving card lost her case when it was revealed it had been hidden from her after only three people signed it. Karen Conaghan claimed that the “failure to acknowledge her existence” at IAG, the parent company ofBritish Airways, was a breach of equality law. However, a former colleague told an employment tribunal that managers had indeed bought a card but did not present it to Conaghan because of the low number of signatures,the Timesreported. The judge, Kevin Palmer, said: “He believed it would have been more insulting to give her the card than not to give her a card at all.” The tribunal was told that two men also laid off during “restructuring” at the company, which also owns airlines Aer Lingus and Iberia, did not receive leaving cards either. Conaghan, a former business liaison lead, brought 40 complaints against the company for sexual harassment, victimisation and unfair dismissal. But the tribunaldismissed every claim, with Palmer concluding that Conaghan, who started working at the company in 2019, had adopted a “conspiracy-theory mentality”, mistaking “normal workplace interactions” for harassment. In one claim, she said a colleague had copied her use of the word “whiz” in a card for a colleague, but corrected her spelling by writing “whizz” instead. She said another employee had asked her: “Are you taking the piss, Karen?” The tribunal heard that this was after Conaghan suggested she had “done all of the hard work” and it was his “turn to do some”. Conaghan moved to Richmond, North Yorkshire, in September 2021 despite it being expected that all employees live within two hours of the office in Heathrow, the tribunal heard. She was made redundant in the same year as part of a restructuring of the organisation, with colleagues saying in evidence that many people also left around the same time. Judge Palmer said that although further signatures were gathered on the leaving card after her departure, a former colleague took the view that “it was inappropriate to send such a card to [her] at a later date as she had raised a grievance against him and [another colleague]”. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Many of the acts cited in the claim “either did not happen or, if they did happen, they were innocuous interactions in the normal course of employment”, the judge ruled. He said that there was no evidence to suggest that any of Conaghan’s allegations were in any way related to her sex and that one of the allegations was indicative of her “view of normal interactions being something more sinister”. In another, unrelated case earlier this year, an employment tribunal judge ruled that sending an employee an unwanted birthday card could amount to “unwanted conduct” and harassment.",Tom Ambrose,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-ambrose,,explore,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/12/woman-leaving-card-employment-claim-tribunal
"Five Great Reads: outback drovers, a recovering Christian, and Marina Abramović",,"Good morning all, we made it to Saturday. This week the world marked one year since the devastating7 October attack, andGaza’s oldest and youngest victimis a moving story I will hold closely. Meanwhile, ferocious Hurricane Milton made landfall in the US, andwe watched onin fear. Let this be your somewhat lighter list, filled with intrigue, reflection, new possibilities, love and something perky to finish. Bill Little has been droving for 40 years. He and his team in central Queensland area modern workforce: experienced drovers riding ahead of horse-loving youth, unexpected stars of the dusty country. The uptick in road transport in the 1950s curbed the art of moving large herds of livestock along stock routes, Mandy McKeesick writes, until a renaissance of sorts happened in the 1980s. Two-week-itis:Little gives the new generation two weeks until “the gloss has worn off … That’s when they work out if they really want to be here”, he says.

On her new record – fused with themes of hope, liberation and release – she excavates her ghostly past while trying out a new way of being: in the moment. (Something we should all try more.) Two decades have passed since the singer-songwriter released her debut album (which she re-listened to very recently and cringed – relatable queen), and the music industry has changed a lot. Artists such as Charli xcx double as content creators, but Blasko refuses to. Although she would love to be invited back to music festivals.

Julia Jacklin on her religious upbringing:In 2022, thesinger-songwriter told the Guardianshe had only recently discovered how much early Catholic messaging shaped her life, particularly her “relationships with people and my sexuality”. But she also said the closest she’d ever “felt to God was watching Jesus Christ Superstar”. Another relatable queen. How long will it take to read:four minutes. In some cultures food waste is considered worse than killing someone. In a cost-of-living crisis, food wastage is surely ludicrous?

‘You can try weirder and weirder things’: once-mocked synthesisers enjoy new golden era,,"Queen refused to use them. The Musicians’ Union tried to ban them. Then computers overtook them. Synthesisers have been mocked, despised and discarded throughout their history, yet somehow they are entering a new golden era. A new wave of synth makers has emerged, creating machines that are more ambitious and often quirkier than their bleep-making predecessors, feeding the appetites of an expanding pool of enthusiasts. Thousands of them, including Portishead’s Adrian Utley, gathered this weekend in Bristol at Machina Bristronica, a festival “of knobs, buttons and discussions”, to play and even make devices that their designers believe sometimes cross the line from musical instruments to conceptual art. Less than a decade ago, anyone hoping to discover the latest in electronic music-making had to make a pilgrimage to Berlin’s annual Superbooth fair, but now there are several in the UK. Last week saw SynthFest UK in Sheffield, and Synth East in Norwich opened its doors for the first time last year. “Loads of people came into making electronic music via the computer,” said Ben Chilton, co-founder of Machina Bristronica. For the last 20 years, software such asCubase, Reason andAbleton Livehas made it easy for anyone to make music with a computer or even on their phones. Software synthesisers are heard in nightclubs everwhere. “People sold their synths when computers were exciting, and after a few years they’ve been yearning for something they can touch,” Chilton said. The ability to shape sounds on the fly in a performance, rather than feeling like you’re programming a machine, is behind the resurgence of synth hardware, he added. Synths have inspired generations of musicians in different ways. Pink Floyd created a menacing soundscape onDark Side of the Moonwith a synth that came in a briefcase. The Human League, Gary Numan and Cabaret Voltaire pioneered the 80s synthpop sound that was later supercharged by the Yamaha DX7. And while Donna Summer’s I Feel Love brought the Moog to disco, modern dance music would have been very different if DJ Pierre and Juan Atkins had not discovered they could push the Roland TB-303 – intended to be a bass replacement – into creating the squelchy sounds of acid house. Modern synthesisers fall into two categories. Self-contained desktop synths usually have a keyboard and many knobs, dials and faders for the player to make the instrument swoop and soar. Then there are synths assembled from different modules – some to generate sounds, others to manipulate them. Modular synths can be simple affairs or extraordinary masses of cables and metal, like a £15,000 colossus created for film composerHans Zimmerthis year for his relaunch of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. In 2013,Sound On Soundreported that there were about 730 modules available for Eurorack, which has become the modular standard. Now there are more than 16,000. Yesterday also marked the 60th anniversary of theMoogmodular, the first commercially available synth. Until 1964, anyone interested in the possibilities of electronic music had to build their own machines, asDelia Derbyshire did with the Radiophonic Workshopwhen she used tape and BBC test equipment to create theDoctor Whotheme tune. Robert Moog’s synth was followed by the Buchla Easel. “At first they were designed with home organists in mind, but by the mid-70s people worked out that they were instruments in their own right – [Jean-Michel] Jarre, Tomita, Vangelis,” said Oli Freke, a synth historian and author ofSynthesizer Evolution. Not everyone liked them. Some musicians feared being replaced and some bands took a stand. Queen put “No Synthesisers!” on the sleeves of four of their albums, and in 1982 the Musicians’ Union passed a resolution to ban Now that almost any sound imaginable can be conjured from a computer, endless choice has driven creators towards more limited devices. Tom Whitwell, former editor ofMixmag, now makes synth modules as Music Thing, and will demonstrate his latest gear, a portable modular synth, at Machina Bristronica today. Sign up toObserved Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion Rising interest in synths is due a to post-pandemic boom and the easy access to Chinese factories, said Whitwell, whose devices have been used by Thom Yorke from Radiohead, James Blake and Ryuichi Sakamoto. “The barriers are much lower,” he said. “I can design something, send a couple of files to Shenzhen, then three weeks later these magic circuit boards will turn up for £25. It means you can try weirder and weirder things for very little risk.” He will help Machina Bristronica attendees make a Mikrophonie, a musical joke inspired byKarlheinz Stockhausenthat captures sounds of synthesiser switches with a microphone to feed back into the machine. The key to synthesisers’ success is that they enable people to play again, said Jack Edwards of BeepBoop Electronics. “It reignites this spark of interest in your environment and the universe, like a child,” he said. “It’s a conversation between the player and the instrument. You tap into something that words can’t describe.”",James Tapper,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/james-tapper,2024-10-12,explore,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/12/synthesisers-musicians-designers-experiment
"Trevor Noah: ‘I’ve met a few people where I’ve thought – yeah, you’re probably an alien’",,"In 2015, the South African comedianTrevor Noahwas plucked from relative obscurity to succeed Jon Stewart as the host of The Daily Show. On its face this seemed an unenviable task; Stewart had hosted for 16 years and it seemed unclear what the show would even be independent of his liberal bona fides and New York sensibility. But Noah’s wit and insight quickly made him a darling of the US left and by bringing an outsider’s perspective – both as a Black man and a recent immigrant – to late-night TV, Noah successfully pushed the show into the social media age. Since departing in 2022, Noah has kept busy, launching a podcast, hosting the Grammys, and winning the prestigious Erasmus prize in 2023. He’s now publishing his first children’s book, Into the Uncut Grass. A spiritual successor to his bestselling memoir, Born a Crime, it’s a coming-of-age story written in the shadow of the last days of apartheid. He sat down for a grilling about his inspiration, influences and creative process from a gaggle of fellow authors. I think people will be surprised to see that Into the Uncut Grass is kind of a picture book. Did the idea takeyouby surprise, too?Frank Cottrell-Boyce, children’s laureate 2024-2026No it didn’t because it was something I’ve always wanted to do. It’s an idea I have always romanticised because the picture books I grew up with, like Where the Wild Things Are, were some of my favourite fables and stories. Children’s picture books don’t allow you to spend 400 pages getting into intricate details. I guess what surprised me was how hard it is to actually do, being so concise while containing feeling and emotion. What was the spark – the first seed of an idea – that got you started on this story?Harlan Coben, mystery novel authorThe seed was going to therapy and realising the reasons adults can’t resolve conflict is because of things we were not taught as children: how to communicate through a disagreement; how to hold conflicting but equally valid opinions; how to compromise; how to see ourselves in relation to others. We are not taught these things as children, and then we wonder why as adults we struggle to come to those realisations. It’s much harder when you’re an adult because you’re entrenched in your views of the world. So the spark was thinking: what would some of those lessons be and how would those lessons be necessary in today’s world? Like you, I’ve written about my mother in fiction and memoir. What positive effects havewriting about your mother-son relationship had on that relationship in real life?Dean Atta, poetOne of the biggest positive effects is that it’s forced me in a very active way to think about why I appreciate my mother, and to see her as a human being and not just as a mother. We never really spend time thinking of our parents as human beings because we are tied to them. It helped me understand why I love my mother beyond because you’re supposed to. When you write about somebody, you get to understand all the shades and layers that make them who they are to you. How daunting was it taking over fromJon Stewarton The Daily Show and what advice if any did he give?Louis Theroux, broadcaster and authorIt was extremely daunting. Just the stress of starting a new position on television that was on every day of the week. Plus I was taking over a beloved position from an institution and a person who had – and continues to have – an indelible impression on American politics. The best advice I got was from Jon Stewart himself, who was gracious enough to show me how much people didn’t believe in him when he took over the show. It was before social media, but he was slammed by the critics. People wrote articles about how he was doomed to fail. I think it was really wonderful of him to show me that there was a time when he was doubted and nobody thought he could do it. Now he seemed like the most obvious choice. The advice he gave me was: just grind away until somebody notices what you’ve created. What was the worst advice you were given as a child?Adam Kay, former doctor and writerI think the worst advice was that you have to try to fit in. You’d meet somebody you don’t get along with and you’d be told: “Just tolerate it for now.” It’s only in later life that you realise that a prison comes with not being yourself around the people you wish to build a life with. So that was probably the worst advice I got as a kid: people telling me to suck it up so that I could maintain connections with other people in my life. The advice I would give a kid today would be: “Be yourself as much as you can.” Some people you’ll lose along the way, but the ones you keep will know the real you.

Do you use voice-recognition tech in different languages?Susie Dent, Countdown lexicographer and authorI don’t use any of the talking assistance, actually. I think they’re stilted and stiff, and I spend more time correcting them than actually getting the information that I’m looking for. I wouldn’t even know how many languages they do or don’t speak. How many languages do I speak? It changes depending on how much I get to practise them. Right now I speak … let me think … English, Zulu, Afrikaans, Tsonga. My German’s not fluent, but I can get by. I’m trying to learn Spanish, so I’ll call it five and a quarter. Apparently you made 315 jokes about President Trump’s first 100 days in office. What was your favourite?Joel Golby, author ofFour Stars: A Life. Reviewed, published byMudlark, out nowI’m going to assume that these jokes were all made on The Daily Show. My only response to that would be I did not make 300 jokes about Trump’s first 100 days in office. I would argue that Trump made 300 things happen that were worthy of being joked about in his first 100 days of office. And so I only observed them and commented on them. I think one of my favourites was when he went into the White House and he got the tour from President Obama. It was hilarious to see how easily taken he was by Barack Obama, leaving him a really lovely note. Trump came into the White House almost antagonistically. He had this bluster that he ran his whole campaign with. After he read the note that Obama had left for him on the desk, Trump almost turned into a romantic in a war movie where they were reading a beautiful letter from their love. One of the more funny stories for me was just how he recounted the story of the letter that Obama left for him. Who is the most annoying man and woman in the world you’ve ever met?Konnie Huq, TV presenter, screenwriter and children’s authorThe most annoying are people in airplanes who stand up before the plane has stopped fully, pull their bags out of the overhead, and then proceed to block other people from standing up when we’re all trying to get out of the airplane. They are in such a desperate need that they’ll crush you and your family to death so that they can get to the baggage carousel two minutes earlier. I think those are the most annoying men and women in the world. I don’t know their names, nor do I wish to know their names. I’ve just written Shadow Play, based on the classic TV show UFO from the 1970s. Have you ever had a close encounteryourself?James Swallow, author and scriptwriterSometimes we look up into the skies, but I don’t know. I feel like if extraterrestrials are as advanced as they are, they can probably disguise themselves to be just like us. I’ve met a few people where I’ve thought to myself: “Yeah, you’re probably an alien.” I try to be as nice to them as possible so that when they come back and invade, they’ll remember me and think: “Oh yeah, that guy was pretty nice. We won’t kill him.” What are the five key elements of a great rollercoaster?Stuart Heritage, Guardian writer and children’s authorI don’t know why it says that I like rollercoasters on my IMDb page. It is true, though. I love rollercoasters. What are some of the key elements? Number one, seating position. Rollercoasters that deviate from the norm have an advantage over rollercoasters where you’re seated in a regular position because your body already feels uncomfortable and primed for something that is going to scare it. A great rollercoaster needs to put you in a position where you are able to see the people beside you. I think it adds to the terror that you’ll experience collectively. Another element of a good rollercoaster is the initial suspense, the initial ascent. It has to have few crazy turns that completely confuse your orientation. You should not know where up is or down. The rollercoaster should also ride around the queue where people are waiting because the suspense is part of how you actually experience the ride. South Africa has many famous things, but we never had a famous rollercoaster. Maybe that’s why I love them.Into the Uncut Grass(illustrated by Sabina Hahn), published byJohn Murray, is out now.

‘I need positive things to come of this’: graphic novelist rocked by brother’s suicide donates profits to charity,,"Zoe Thorogood was walking back to her flat in Bradford last month when she got the call. For two days she had been trying to track down her younger brother, but with no luck. The 26-year-old graphic novelist had sent James “some funny reels on Instagram, and they were ignored”. This wasn’t unusual – sometimes he would take days to get back to her. “But it was when his girlfriend messaged me saying that James hadn’t seen her message in 10 hours that I phoned him. His phone was off. I then phoned mum and it all exploded from there.” Nobody knew where James was. His absence was reported to the police, which Thorogood calls a “hideously infuriating experience”, leading her to try to track him down through friends and online contacts. “And that’s when I started to panic because they also claimed to know nothing,” she says. “I walked home and as I was around 50 metres from my flat, my dad phoned. He was ­crying. Dad doesn’t cry. I knew what that meant. He just told me to come home, and nothing more. I just remember falling on to the floor screaming in the street.” James had taken his own life. And once the dust had begun to settle from the bomb that had been thrown under the family, Thorogood decided she had to do something to help other families like them, and perhaps stop what happened to James, “now eternally 23”, happening to others. Thorogood has a platform and a following, as one of Britain’s top young graphic novelists. Last year, at the famous San Diego comic convention,she was nominated for five Eisner awards, the comics industry’s Oscars, almost unprecedented for such a young creator. She debuted as a graphic novelist in 2020 withThe Impending Blindness of Billie Scott, published by Avery Hill and based on her own experiences of when it was feared she might lose her sight as a child, and her major breakthrough work wasIt’s Lonely at the Centre of the Earth, an autobiographical tale of her own battles with depression and mental ill health, which brought her international attention. Her work, she says, “feels worthless right now. I’ve had people claim that my work may have ‘saved their lives’, yet, I couldn’t even ‘save’ my own brother. I think being a ‘mental health artist’, or whatever you want to call me, and going through this feels like a giant hand coming out of the clouds and pointing at me and laughing. I know this feeling is temporary, but right now, I hate art.” But in the wake of James’s death she announced that all profits fromIt’s Lonely at the Centre of The Earth,which was published by US comics giant Image, will be donated to ­mental health charities. The publishers of the Italian, French and Spanish ­editions have said they will match the donations. “The idea was a very knee-jerk reaction I think,” said Thorogood. “I was in shock for a few days and I think I felt desperate to do something. It was after a conversation I had with my dad, where we agreed that good things had to come of this for our own sakes. We’d heard from others who’d lost loved ones that the pain never goes and your life is never the same. And we just decided that’s not us. “So even if I had to force it, I need positive things to come of this. For my own mental health. Maybe that’s ­selfish but I figure an initiative like this is helping everyone, so whatever. This book is about mental health, features James, and it’s how I make money – it made perfect sense to me.” Male suicide is a growing ­problem in the UK. According to government statistics released this year, out of 5,354 suicides between April 2023 and June 2024, almost 4,000 were men or boys. Many charities and awareness campaigns have been trying to get men, traditionally reticent about opening up about their feelings, to talk more. Sign up toObserved Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion James, who ran his own 3D ­printing business, did suffer from ­mental health difficulties, but what was even more of a shock to the family was that, according to Thorogood, he did not fit the traditional mould of the young man keeping his troubles locked inside. “I understand the narrative of men not talking about their feelings, but James did not fit that,” she says. “I shut down when I’m depressed and ignore the world, but my brother would phone me sobbing at four in the morning, and I’m glad he would. Though, in the past few weeks he was better than he’d been in a while, at least to me.” The siblings grew up on a farm, and with a three-year age gap were close as children. “I think mostly because I forced him into friendship,” says Thorogood. “I was a very brash child, and James was very reserved. But we spent a lot of time together. Playing Lego and video games. We were close but we bickered a lot – a standard sibling relationship I guess. “In my teenage years we drifted entirely. I had just been diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 14 and was handling it poorly. I was skipping a lot of school and being a general menace. James was always so good and well behaved, very lawful and kind, quite serious. And I was the opposite. I’d kind of decided James and I would never be close, thanks to our opposite personalities. This was until around three years ago when he, pretty randomly, asked to phone me. “He was telling me about ­worries with his mental health, and I guess because I’d been through it a ­decade prior he thought to talk to me about it. We discussed our childhood and life situations, and slowly over the last few years became, from my ­perspective, and I hope he felt the same, best friends. We phoned almost every week, and texted almost daily.” Thorogood has put her own struggles into her work, and had discussed with James a follow-up to her book, “telling other people’s stories of mental health and trauma”. She had discussed with him using his experiences for a new project, to be calledIt’s Crowded at the Centre of the Earth, detailing his issues, treatment and recovery. “I don’t see myself making that book anymore, at least for a long time,” she says. “I think I could make something poignant and helpful eventually, but I don’t know when.” Thorogood and her family will decide at the end of the year which charities will benefit from the profits generated by the sales ofIt’s Lonely, but they will be organisations that help men struggling with mental health. She says: “I think men have a real issue with discussing their feelings and being able to admit to mental health issues. There’s a shame women don’t feel as much. I assume there’s pressure to appear strong, but there’s nothing stronger than going against the grain and stepping out of the box you’ve built for yourself.” Contact the Samaritansfor free from any telephone on 116 123.

"Oceanographer Dawn Wright: ‘When we reached the bottom, we saw a beer bottle’",,"The American oceanographer Dawn Wright is the first Black person and only the 27th human to have been to the deepest spot on the planet. Challenger Deep, at the southern end of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, is 10.9km (6.8 miles) below sea level – deeper than Mount Everest (8.8km [5.5 miles]) is tall. Wright’s summer 2022 descent is documented in a new book,Mapping the Deep, written with her input. The dive was undertaken in a two-person submersible called Limiting Factor owned (since sold) byCaladan Oceanic, an ocean expedition company founded by investor turned deep sea explorerVictor Vescovo, who was also the craft’s pilot. Wright, 63, who also goes by the moniker “Deepsea Dawn”, is the chief scientist of Esri, a multinational that makes geographic information system (GIS) software for mapping and spatial analytics. Sending people to the deep ocean can be dangerous because of the extreme underwater pressure.Last year,OceanGate’sTitan submersible implodedon a journey to view the wreck of theTitanic, killing allfivepassengers on board. Why not just leave it to robots?Most of the exploration in the ocean is done by robots – it’s just more efficient, especially for mapping. But occasionally, it is important for a human to go down. It can betheway to get the best understanding of how a particular part of the Earth is working or solve a scientific mystery. In the case of Challenger Deep it is an iconic place and we had a scientific mission. OceanGatedidn’t take proper safety precautions. The sub wasn’t certified, and the hull was cylindrical and made of carbon fibre. The sub I went down in had a hull machined to be as close to perfectly spherical as possible – it is the geometry that protects you from hydrostatic pressure – and it was made of titanium – the strongest material for the purpose. It was also certified: I wouldn’t have gone otherwise. What was the scientific point of your trip?Challenger Deep is made up of three depressions and my dive was to the least visited, Western Pool. We were the first to set eyes on some of the ground we covered. On the engineering side, it was to test a prototype instrument: a portable sidescan sonar specifically designed to withstand pressure and work at any ocean depth. Then we undertook multibeam sonar mapping from the support ship to give us a fresh map of the entirety of Challenger Deep and the Mariana Trench. That data has been deposited withSeabed 2030, a global collaborative effort to completely map the seabed by 2030 which Esri is part of. What was the dive like and what did you see?It was about a 10-hour round trip with two-and-a-half hours at the bottom to observe and test the prototype instrument, which we did over an area of a few hundred square metres. The spherical cockpit is a tight space and Victor and I sat with everything that we needed within reach. There is no toilet, so I had to safely dehydrate before the dive. At around 1,000m you get into complete darkness. Through the sub’s portholes, we saw bioluminescent jellyfish and worm-like siphonophores, which flashed back at us when Victor flashed the sub’s lights on them. The first moments of reaching the bottom were disheartening – we saw a beer bottle – but the rest was wonderful. We observed vast fields of boulders: evidence of the two tectonic plates that are colliding in that zone (the old, heavy Pacific Plate is diving underneath the Philippine Sea Plate). And we saw tiny creatures such as anemones, sea cucumbers and amphipods [a type of crustacean] – all withstanding huge pressure and functioning in complete darkness and cold. Our images and samples are being studied by marine biologists. Your career includesover 20 ship-basedresearch expeditions anddives in other submersibles. You have also pioneered the application of GIS to seafloor and ocean mapping. What got you interested in ocean science?I grew up in the Hawaiian islands and I was always at the beach. But I became fascinated by the geology too: living somewhere that started off as volcanoes under the sea and then rose. Combine that with watching Jacques Cousteau on TV and reading ocean adventure books and I made the decision at age eight to become an oceanographer. My first submersible dive was in 1991 in a research vessel called Alvin. It was to make observations of the geology and biology and map the distribution of hydrothermal vents (undersea hot springs) in a segment of the East Pacific Rise, the seafloor spreading zone in the Pacific Ocean. It was one of the first studies applying GIS to seabed mapping anywhere. You can get lost in a map of the ocean floor. One of your bugbears is that so little of the seafloor has been mapped to date in high resolution. Is it reallythatbad?Yes! Our current collective estimate is that we have 26.1% of the ocean mapped to the modern detail that we need. That’s a lot we don’t know about our home, given about 70% of our planet is ocean. The longer it takes for us to mapallthe seabed in detail, the more we play with fire: it is vital for so many things. For example, it gives us a better understanding of ocean volume, enabling climate scientists to build better models of climate change, improves our predictions of how tsunamis will behave and enables the design of protected marine habitats. Interest is growing indeep-sea mining. The International Seabed Authority plans to release regulations on the practice next year whileNorwayispressingaheadwith opening its own waters. Can deep-sea mining be done sustainably? Won’t better mapping of the seafloor aid mining companies to pursue extraction?The Seabed 2030 data is unlikely to be fine-grained enough for a mining operation. But the project’s data is open: anyone can use it. If mining companies are doing their own mapping of the seafloor, my hope is they would be willing to contribute it to Seabed 2030 to speed up ocean mapping and benefit us all. At this point, I don’t think it is possible to do it sustainably. The environmental assessments aren’t done and many of us don’t trust that they will be done properly. I have, in my personal capacity, signed astatement from marine expertscalling for a moratorium while potential impacts to the ocean environment are studied. I worry it would be massively damaging to large parts of the seafloor which are habitats to all sorts of biota. What would you like young women of colour who want a career in ocean science to know?That this type of work is for them too! And that there areorganisations that supportBlack marine scientists that weren’t there when I was coming along. All young people should pursue what they love and not let others divert them from that path. I was told once I was not cut out to be an oceanographer: I’m glad I didn’t follow that advice.

‘Russia’s dirty money will hijack our democratic process’: how tiny Moldova fears Kremlin is fixing EU referendum,,"Last spring, customs officers in the tiny nation ofMoldovastruck gold. Acting on a national intelligence tip-off from, they intercepted more than 100 passengers arriving from Russia via Armenia, each carrying bundles of cash just shy of €10,000 – the threshold for mandatory declaration. In a single night authorities at Chișinău airport seized more than €900,000. Moldovan officials swiftly announced that the cash couriers were part of a scheme allegedly led by a Kremlin-linked fugitive oligarch and aimed at financing protesters and buying votes in this month’s presidential election and pivotal EU referendum. The operation offered an early indication of what Moldovan and western officials have described in interviews with theObserveras an unprecedented effort byRussiato undermine the country’s bid for EU membership and weaken the authority of its pro-western president through a series of destabilising campaigns. “Russia is pouring millions in dirty money to hijack our democratic processes. This isn’t just meddling – it’s full-blown interference aimed at destabilising our future. And it is alarming,” said Olga Roşca, a foreign policy adviser to the pro-western president, Maia Sandu. The election, set for 20 October, in which Sandu faces re-election, is to be held on the same day as a referendum asking Moldovans whether they support constitutional changes that could eventually enable the country – one of the poorest inEurope– to join the EU. Roşca said the government estimated that at least €100m was being funneled into Moldova from Russia to manipulate the elections and EU referendum. It is not the first warning about Russian interference: in June, the US, UK and Canada said Moscow was trying to meddle in Moldovan politics and would seek to provoke mass protests if its campaign fails. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Moldova has gravitated between pro-western and pro-Russian courses, though the shadow of the Kremlin has always loomed large. Moscow also has 1,500 troops stationed in Transnistria, a region run by pro-Russian separatists who broke away from the control of Moldova’s government in a brief war in the 1990s. Sandu, a former World Bank official, was electedpresident in November 2020, riding a wave of popularity as an anti-corruption reformer with a pro-European agenda. She has advocated a humble lifestyle – a sharp contrast to the bombastic, predominantly male politicians who have long dominated Moldovan politics. In a recent interview, the president said she was sharing a two-bedroom apartment with her mother, while in her asset declaration from 2023 her bank balance was recorded as $600. In 2021, Sandu’s pro-western party, PAS, won a majority in the country’s parliamentary elections, giving her unprecedented power to implement reforms and push the country toward the west. But, three years later, Moldova remains mired in economic and political instability. First, the country was plunged into an energy crisis when Kremlin-controlled Gazpromslashed gas suppliesto the country by one-third and demanded more than double the previous rates to maintain the flow, in what was widely seen as political payback from Moscow for Sandu’s pro-western stance. Then, Russia’s war on Ukraine pushed Moldova into a broader financial crisis. Located just a few hoursdrive from Odesa, Moldova took in the highest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita, placing immense strain on its healthcare system, public services, and infrastructure. Inflation surged byas much as 40%as trade with both Moscow and Kyiv sharply declined. Stray Russian missiles from the conflict added to the growing sense of danger, while the Russian troops stationed in Transnistria further amplified anxieties. “Sandu promised a lot, but the geopolitical situation has been very tough on her. They have not been able to deliver on all promises,” said a western official in Moldova, reflecting on the growing frustration among some Moldovans with Sandu and her party. “There is growing apathy and disappointment, which provides a fertile ground for Russia,” the official added. Sandu remains the favourite to win the first-round presidential vote against 10 challengers, but she is facing a tricky second-round runoff. She is also leading the “Yes” campaign for the EU referendum, with polls showing 55-65% of voters in favour of joining the bloc. In a major boost for Sandu, Moldova officiallybegan EU accession negotiations in June. However, scepticism remains high about the country’s ability to implement the necessary democratic and judicial reforms in the near future. Critics from the opposition have accused Sandu of politicising the referendum by holding it on the same day as the presidential election, suggesting that the move is designed to boost her own political chances. “The referendum is a very cynical move,” said Alexandr Stoianoglo in Chișinău, one of Sandu’s main rivals from the Russian-friendly socialist party, who is polling at 12%. “EU integration should not be used for personal gain,” he added. But those close to Sandu said Russia’s growing influence means the country cannot afford to wait. “We have a unique opportunity: Moldova has a pro-European president, parliament, and government. The EU is open to our membership, with all countries backing accession talks last June,” said Roşca. “Moldova’s survival as a democracy is on the line, and the geopolitical stakes are higher than ever,” said Roşca. The biggest threat for Sandu comes from abroad, say her supporters. In particular, the fugitive pro-Russian businessman Ilan Shor, a vocal – and wealthy – opponent of EU membership who has been sanctioned by the west. Shor was sentenced to 15 years in prisonlast yearin absentia in connection with his role in the disappearance of $1bn from Moldova’s banking system. He fled to Israel and then Moscow where he set up a political movement aimed at destabilising the current government in Chișinău. At a press conference last Thursday, national police chief Viorel Cernăuțanu accused Shor and Moscow of establishing a complex “mafia-style” voter-buying scheme and bribing 130,000 Moldovans to vote against the referendum and in favour of Russia-friendly candidates in what he called an “unprecedented, direct attack”. Officials in Chișinău also believe Shor is behind a wave of pre-election vandalism attacks on government buildings, accusing him of recruiting young people who were allegedly trained in Moscow to cause unrest in the country. “We are prepared for anything in the coming weeks,” said a security official in the city. “It will be a variety of misinformation campaign, violent street protests and crude vote buying,” they added. Shor did not reply to questions from theObserver. But he has done little to distance himself from the accusations of trying to interfere in Moldovan politics from abroad. Through the social network Telegram, he has offered to pay voters the equivalent of $29 if they registered for his campaign, promising money to people who would “convince as many people as possible at their polling station” to vote “no or abstain” in the referendum. He has publicly pledged to pay Moldovans for publishing anti-EU posts on Facebook and Telegram. The central “fear-mongering” narrative that Shor has been promoting centres around the claim that Chișinău’s pro-European policies are pushing the country towards war with Russia, said VadimPistrinciuc, the director at the Institute for Strategic Initiatives of Moldova, a thinktank. “We have never faced this level of foreign interference,” he added. Worryingly for officials in Chisinau, Shor’s tactics have proven effective elsewhere the country. Last year, Yevgenia Gutsul, a previously unknown Shor-backed candidate, caused a political earthquake by winning the elections of governor in Gagauzia, another small, Russian-speaking semi-autonomous region in the south of the country. Pro-Russian sentiments have always been high in Gagauzia, a region populated by a Turkic ethnic minority, which has had an uneasy relationship with the capital Chisinau since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union. But Gutsul’s rise from obscurity and her ties to the Kremlin has stunned even seasoned observers and have prompted questions over Moscow’s role in her elections. “She was polling at zero two weeks before the elections and then suddenly she appears and wins,” said Mihail Sirkeli, founder of Nokta, an independent media outlet based in Gagauzia. Gutsul, who has openly declared running “a pro-Russian party” and travelled to Moscow to meet withVladimir Putinafter her election, is currently under investigation for allegedly funnelling Russian funds to a party associated with Shor. “Shor is looking to repeat the Gagauzia playbook across the country,” said a western diplomat in Chisinau. For now, officials in Moldova believe Moscow is concentrating its efforts on influencing the EU referendum, rather than the presidential elections where Sandu remains by far the most popular politician. “If the referendum passes, it will lead to constitutional changes, which are harder to reverse in the long term compared to election outcomes,” said a senior Moldovan official. But even if Sandu survives this month’s vote and referendum, her team expects renewed Kremlin efforts next year when her party faces re-election in the country’s parliamentary elections. “Russia’s goal is clear: to keep Moldova stuck in a grey zone,” said Roşca. “If they lose Moldova, they lose a strategic foothold in the region.”",Pjotr Sauer,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pjotr-sauer,,explore,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/moldova-fears-kremlin-fixing-eu-referendum-russia

Kamala Harris releases medical report saying she is in ‘excellent health’,,"Kamala Harrison Saturday releaseda report on her health and medical history, which found that “she possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency” if voters elect her in November. A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president’s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions aboutDonald Trump’s physical fitness and mental acuity. The 78-year-old Republican White House nominee would be the oldest president elected if Americans gave him a second term in the Oval Office. Saturday’s report – in the form of atwo-page letterfrom the vice-president’s physician, Joshua Simmons – described Harris as being in “excellent health” and asserted that her medical history was notable for seasonal allergies and hives. Harris manages those conditions with over-the-counter medications such as Allegra, Atrovent nasal spray and Pataday eye drops, and she has been on allergen immunotherapy for three years, the letter said. Otherwise, Harris is mildly nearsighted and wears corrective contact lenses as a result, had abdominal surgery when she was three years old and has a maternal history of colon cancer. “She has no personal history of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, neurological disorders, cancer or osteoporosis,” said the letter from Simmons, who added that the vice-president’s most recent physical examination in April was “unremarkable”. The statement on Harris’s health came on Saturday as Trump has becomeincreasingly incoherentat campaign rallies, something the Guardian US reported on earlier in October. He has been slurring, stumbling over his words, hurling expletives – and showing signs of cognitive decline consistent with someone approaching his 80s, according to medical experts. Recent speeches have seen him rant about topics ranging from his purportedly “beautiful” body to “a million Rambos” in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Harris campaign aides pointed to Trump’s backing out of an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes that the vice-president granted and his refusal to debate her again after their 10 September face-off. They argue that the former president is “avoiding public scrutiny” and giving voters “the impression … that he has something to hide and may not be up for the job”. “Contrast her age and vitality with his,” the senior aide to Harris, 59, said early on Saturday. Trump hasrepeatedly declined to release detailed information about his healthduring his public life. For instance, before winning the White House in 2016, he only offered a four-paragraph letter from his personal doctor that bragged that Trump would be “the healthiest person ever elected to the presidency”, as the New York Times recently reported. Trump’s first physical as president resulted in perhaps the most detailed overview of his health to date. According to the Times, the physical flagged “worryingly high” cholesterol and a body mass index that left him 0.1 points below the threshold for medical obesity. Nonetheless, in a statement on Saturday, a Trump campaign spokesperson claimed the former president regularly distributed medical updates and that all “have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be commander in chief”. “It is said [Harris] does not have the stamina of … Trump,” the campaign spokesperson’s statement also said. Questions over whetherJoe Bidenwas too enfeebled forced him to halt his bid for re-election to the presidency during the summer. The 81-year-old Democrat dropped out of a rematch with Trump on 21 July and endorsed Harris to succeed him. Recentnational polling averagesshow Harris with a two-point edge over Trump in the 5 November race for the presidency. But key swing states remain too close to call, and most experts expect a competitive election. The Republican party chose Trump as their nominee despite his being convicted in May of criminally falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments to an adult film actor who claimed an extramarital sexual encounter with him about a decade before his successful run for the presidency in 2016. Among other legal problems, he is grappling with criminal charges that he tried to illicitly overturn his defeat to Biden in the 2020 election. Trump, for his part, has maintained that Biden “became mentally impaired”. He also said that Harris “was born that way” while struggling to pronounce the vice-president’s name. At a town hall in Las Vegas for a group of undecided voters on Thursday, Harris said “using language that’s belittling … [is not] healthy for our nation”. “I don’t admire that,” Harris said. “And in fact, I’m quite critical of it coming from someone who wants to be president of the United States.”",Ramon Antonio Vargas,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ramon-antonio-vargas,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/kamala-harris-to-release-health-report-saying-she-is-fit-for-presidency-aide
Dome of sweltering NT heat set to spread across vast swathes of Australia,,"Much of Australia’s south will likely bask in temperatures up to 8C hotter than normal next week, which could trigger an increased risk of thunderstorms over wide areas. A dome of heat that has put parts of the Northern Territory under heatwave warnings is set to spread east and west in the coming days, before moving south by the middle of next week, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Parts of the Top End around Darwin have sweltered under a heatwave for much of the last two weeks, with temperatures up to 5C above normal and hitting 41C. The bureau’s official heatwave warning is likely to stay in place for a few more days, and the heat is expected to spread into Western Australia’s Kimberley and east over the Cape York peninsula in the early part of the week. Angus Hines, senior meteorologist at the bureau, said on Saturday: “Some of that heat from the north-west will be spreading into central Australia. It’s going to be a gradual build as that heat moves over the course of a few days starting from today.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email By Wednesday or Thursday, Hines said forecast models showed temperatures 4C to 8C above average stretching from the centre of WA to the New South Wales coast. “Most of the country will be seeing above average temperatures,” he said. The early part of the week would also carry the risk of thunderstorms across large areas of the south and east. “We will see the humidity climb and that combination of warmth and humidity could feed thunderstorm developments across eastern states,” Hines said. “It’s a messy map with broad areas that could be hit and miss [for storms]. It’s hard to pinpoint the detail … but there’s multiple areas for thunderstorm activity from Monday to Wednesday.” Hines said the area of likely thunderstorm development was across NSW, Victoria, southern Queensland and northern Tasmania.

"A week in a swing state taught me a lot about the Maga cult, and gave me hope for Kamala Harris",,"To attend a Trump rally in rural America makes you worry for humanity’s future. After six hours in the baking sun watching 60,000-plus Trump supporters lap up his lies, I am here to tell you that there are few more lowering experiences to be had in modern politics. But it isn’t all we have, and there is much of a positive nature to report from the US, including aninspiring interventionfrom Barack Obama last week and the truth that the Democrat candidate for presidency, Kamala Harris, is conducting a very good campaign indeed. Given that she’s had just three months to pick her running mate, coordinate strategy and key messaging, and confront a wretchedly divided nation, she’s performing with grace and steadiness, while the campaign has united around building a coalition with disaffected Republicans and conservatives of conscience who were in Congress or the Trump administration. For the first time since July, when Harris became the Democrat candidate, theNew York Times/Siena College pollshows her leading Trumpby three points, 49-46. In the average maintained byThe Hillwebsite she is showing a lead of 3.4. Sure, both are within the margin of error and the contest in the seven swing states is much tighter, but the trends are in her favour. She is improving on the key issues of economy and migration and is becoming the candidate of change. A persistent Maga attack line over the last months was that she was too scared, ignorant or dumb to do interviews. She answered it by sitting down with Alex Cooper’sCallHer Daddypodcast, giving a fascinatinginterview to Howard Stern’s radio show, sharing a beer with Stephen Colbert on his late-night show, and announcing, on Whoopi Goldberg’sThe Viewthat, if she won,Medicare would pay for home care. Finally, she faced the remorseless Bill Whitaker in the60 Minutesinterview, an October ordeal for presidential candidates for the last 50 years. She carried herself well and was never less than poised.As I wrote in this paper, I once spent a few hours with her at a social event and liked her a lot but, after seeing those five shows, I feel a duty to note that she can be extraordinarily slippery when it comes to answering questions. Yet she is abiding by all the rules of the democratic game, unlike Donald Trump who refuses to engage in the process and tours his own rallies, ranting and lying, and looking somehow more lumpen and angrier than ever before. Naturally, hepulled out of the60 Minutesinterview, first saying that he didn’t want to be fact checked, then demanding an apology from his previous interviewer Lesley Stahl for something she hadn’t done. There was a fuss about the edit of the Harris programme, which Maga claimed showed the vice-president in a favourable light – it didn’t – but before that got traction the news moved on with two newspaper articles. TheNew York Timesran a story loggingTrump’s mental decline, then, seemingly to prove its point, Trump took himself to the swing state of Michigan last Thursday andtrashed the city of Detroitin a speech to, yes, the Detroit Economic Club. TheWashington Postpublished exclusives from Bob Woodward’s new bookWarthat revealed thatTrump sent Covid tests to Putinand had spoken to him from Mar-a-Lago, the country club where he was alleged to have kept stolen secret documents in a bathroom. The mostdelightful revelationwas a quote from Republican senator Lindsey Graham. “Going to Mar-a-Lago is like being in North Korea. Everybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.” One further positive note. Harris has pulled in over $1bn in campaign donations and is outspending Trump on social media, which is smart because 16 million young people have joined the electorate since 2020.Latest figures showshe’s spent $57m with Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, to Trump’s $6m, and on Google, owner of YouTube, $31.5m compared with Trump’s $9.3m. I spent the week in the state of Pennsylvania, which is the epicentre of the race because it has 19 electoral college votes – the most of any swing state. If a candidate wins by just a handful of individual ballots, he or she will take all the state’s 19 electoral college votes, and probably go on to win the White House. The race is effectively tied and both candidates are putting enormous effort into the state. Trump appeared there twice last week, most theatrically at a big rally in the western town of Butler, 35 miles from Pittsburgh, and where he was winged by a would-be assassin three months ago. It was atriumphant return, with much fanfare and many turns and speakers, including JD Vance and a goofy-looking Elon Musk in “dark” Maga cap. Halfway between a revivalist meeting and a country fair, the event told me a lot about the Maga cult but nothing about politics or Trump’s plans (Project 2025is never mentioned). However, I did establish the truth of rumours that hundreds of people leave his rallies as soon as he starts speaking. Last Wednesday, the splendidly principled conservative politician Liz Cheney, who appeared briefly with Harris on60 Minutesafter endorsing her, hosted a session at Glenside, Pennsylvania, with three female former staffers in the Trump White House who provided insights into Trump’s character and the chaos he brought to every issue and situation. This was peripheral to the main campaign but the impact of coherent and respectedRepublicansspeaking against Trump may bring critical votes to Harris. Every vote matters. “Don’t boo,” Obama routinely says, “Vote!” Sign up toObserved Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion Obama made his first appearance for Harris in Pittsburgh, last Thursday, reclaiming the territory in western Pennsylvania from the Trump rally five days before. The speech was among the best he’s ever given, ranking among his appeals to the American public during the 2008 presidential campaign and the wonderful acceptance speech I saw him make in Chicago. Heteased Trump remorselessly, mocking his lies, the obsession with money, power and status and his “concepts of a plan”. He imagined Trump doing something normal like changing a tyre or a nappy. Someone in the audience shouted out, “his own”. Obama smiled and said he’d thought of that joke but resisted the temptation. This drives Trump and Maga to distraction because, like all those with fascist leanings, they cannot stand people making fun of them. Humour will be an important weapon in the next 23 days because the Democrats need to get under his skin and provoke him to show his truly toxic, bullying nature. Obama’s speech was important for its moral indignation, and it may just be the start of national rejection of Trump’s lies, a kind of have-you-no-sense-of-decency moment that recalls the time in 1954 when a lawyer namedJoseph Welch stood up to Joe McCarthyand ended his communist witch-hunt. It could be that Trump and Maga have overreached themselves with their lies about emergency funding afterHurricane Heleneripped through the south-west causing destruction and hundreds of deaths; in one case a family of 11 was wiped out in a mudslide. According to Obama: “Donald Trump just started making up stories about the Biden administration withholding aid from Republican areas and siphoning off aid to give to immigrants… you’ve got a guy who lies to score political points. I want to ask Republicans out there, when did that become OK? Why would we go along with that?” Obama is practically the only person in America who has the moral authority to make this speech. He and his wife, Michelle, are still the most popular and trusted public figures in the country. Republicans will listen to him because, despite the last nine years, ideas of decency and service still have a potent appeal here. What do I think will happen? I agree with the Democrat activist I met in Philadelphia who said: “We’re winning, but we haven’t won yet.” It’s all to play for and in Harris theDemocratshave an authentic and tireless candidate who would do the best job she could in the White House. But let me just warn that even if she wins on 5 November, Trump will not accept defeat. There is evidence that Republicans are building a case to challenge the result by manipulating the late polls in his favour so that any Democrat victory looks like a steal. There will be months of dispute, agonising waits and, I am afraid, intolerable anxiety for us all.

The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet his running mate that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist,the New York Times has reported. X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform. The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them. Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that had been hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point, Trump hadsaidhe hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files. The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party. Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan. Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”. Klippenstein, whose X account was restored following the New York Times reporting, said in aSubstack post on Fridaythat Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”. “The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote. “Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.” Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania.",Oliver Milman,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/oliver-milman,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/x-twitter-jd-vance-leaked-file

"They are relics of the Gondwana age but five years after Australia’s black summer these trees are dying a ‘long, slow death’",,"Thousands of years of accumulated leaf fall makes the ground bounce like a mattress underfoot and, high above, rainforest coachwood trees form a dense canopy that dresses the understory in permanent shade. Some of the unique plants in this rainforest can trace their lineage back 40 or 50m years when the Gondwana supercontinent was breaking apart and Australia was detaching itself from what is now Antarctica. Take only a few steps from the cool shade and you emerge to something altogether different. Still rainforest, but changing fast. Soil and rocks are exposed and, above, the leafless branches of tall and dead trees let the sunlight strike the forest floor. This is a place packed with threatened species, including the nightcap oak – a true Gondwanan relic that grows nowhere else. On the ground and at the base of the thin-barked trees is charcoal. Five years ago, chunks of this in rainforest not evolved to burn, did burn, during what became known as Australia’s black summer bushfires. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “It can take a lot of these trees a long time to die. It is a long, slow death,” says Dr Robert Kooyman, an evolutionary ecologist who has spent more than 40 years working and studying the rainforests in and around Nightcap national park in northernNew South Wales. About 73,000 sq km of forest were burned in the east and south of the country during black summer and the fires scorched the habitat of about 3 billion native animals. Half of the world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests – a network of 40 parks and reserves – were affected by the fires that were driven by global heating. Fires burned into about 10% of the rainforest in the Nightcap area and affected about 30% of the rainforest’s margin, says Kooyman. Kooyman discovered the nightcap oak in the late 1980s. Unlike Australia’s many eucalypt species, rainforest trees have not evolved to deal with fire. “It burns around the base and it cooks the cambium layer – the live wood – and the bark. It triggers this slow-motion death and you can see the progressive stages here,” he says, pointing to trees in various stages of that slow death. The fires killed about a third of the mature nightcap oaks, he says, leaving 181 behind. Kooyman’s monitoring shows 72 of those are struggling to survive, or have lost their main stem and now persist “as suckers only”. “That one’s on the way out,” says Kooyman, pointing to a nightcap whose bark and stem is split and is covered by fungi. “That one is failing too,” says Kooyman, pointing to another. “And this was a low-intensity burn.” There is smoke in the air from a nearby hazard reduction burn on the day Kooyman takes us to the marked-out plots where he and colleagues are monitoring every post-fire breath, death and revival. Traps made from net and laundry baskets catch and record whatever falls from the canopy; straps called dendrometers measure trunk growth; and then there are recordings of temperature, humidity, light and seed generation, and the state of the soil. “They can shrink before they die,” says Kooyman, pointing to one of the dendrometers. “The theory of negative growth is real – that would drive the economists crazy,” he laughs. As we leave to look at another patch of burnt rainforest, Kooyman yanks a young wattle that’s sprouting. The fires removed the leaf litter on the forest floor, creating a perfect bed for dormant wattle seeds to germinate. They have been growing at an incredible density – as many as 30,000 a hectare (12,100 an acre). “They’ll create a fire influence inside the rainforest,” he says. “If we had a dry season and another fire, there are huge amounts of this vegetation that would explode in flames. That’s the problem. You end up with a fire-prone landscape.” The fires here were followed within months by torrential rain and violent floods that blasted the banks of the rock-strewn creeks and swept away weakened trees and plants. Kooyman used to see platypus here but since the fires, there’s no sign. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion More than once on this day, Kooyman bristles when the word “recovery” comes up. For fire-adapted forests, the word “recovery” might be fair, but not for rainforests, he says. “Let’s not let this terminology overwhelm us. This is not recovery,” he says, pointing to a 2ft-tall sucker growing from the base of a dead trunk. “What we have discovered is that even after almost five years, the trajectory is still in reverse. The impacts are accumulating and it hasn’t stabilised.” “Do we want these forests in the future? Do we log them? Do we have them crisped by climate change, or do we start compensating for what we know is happening and protect them?” The fire that hit Nightcap national park and the neighbouring Whian Whian state conservation area started in late October as a lightning strike and gained momentum as the extreme heat and dry of 2019 was joined by winds. Kooyman is an honorary research fellow at Sydney’s Macquarie University, a researcher at the city’s Royal Botanical Gardens and scientist with Missouri Botanical Gardens programs in west Africa and Madagascar. But he lives less than an hour’s drive from Nightcap and got to his beloved rainforest within days as the ground was still smouldering. “I did find myself, not depressed but, maybe like PTSD working in these impact zones. I’m not inclined to any level of depression, but this has had an impact on me. You catch yourself being a little angrier or shorter [tempered] than usual. “Having never lived through these sorts of events at those scales it takes some adjusting.” Kooyman is 71, but he moves like someone half his age. Several times this morning, he jumps from his four-wheel drive to chainsaw trees that have fallen across the track. “I’m feeling an urgency now and it’s not so much down to my sunset clause,” he says. In a break, he puts his laptop on the bonnet to show some images of his plots. They look like landscape ink drawings of the forest you might hang on your wall. But these delicate strokes are the artefacts of data from laser scans of the parts of the forest he’s been monitoring. The areas that escaped the fire have a dense and continuous canopy shrouding the understory. But the scans taken from areas that burned show a canopy that is barely a canopy at all. Technology is moving fast and Kooyman is excited that new approaches, like LiDAR scanning, could give him answers to questions he has been chasing his whole career. “We’re getting deeper insights into how these rainforest systems work. So I’m excited,” he says. “But the irony is we’re getting better at measuring decline.”",Graham Readfearn,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/graham-readfearn,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/nightcap-national-park-rainforest-trees-age-bushfires-impact
Sculpture by the Sea 2024: giant melanoma on Sydney beach to deliver ‘message that will be hard to ignore’,,"Sculpture has a knack of provoking debate. The medium’s ability to divide viewers on the aesthetics of a work – and often itscost to the public purse– can make sculpture a polarising subject. But it’s rare for a work to claim it may save lives. Working in the field of advertising, Sydney creative Andrew Hankin is not above hyperbole. But his team’s entry into this year’sSculptureby the Sea could very well save a life or lives, as visitors to Tamarama gaze down in horror/awe/morbid fascination at a gargantuan sculpture resembling a melanoma. Creator of the enormousWe’re Fryin’ Out Here’frying pan for the 2014 Sculpture by the Sea, Hankin is reprising his skin cancer awareness-through-art project with an inflatable sculpture constructed from heavy-duty fabric. Titled Melanoma, the work will almost imperceptibly change in size, shape and colour as the outdoor exhibition progresses. It may be less lighthearted that his previous work, Hankin acknowledges, but a decade on he felt a more “cutting approach” was needed. “It’s a really big issue, and I think in the sense of bigness, we wanted to go out there and create something that hadn’t been done before in terms of scale,” he says. “It’s going to have a message that will be hard to ignore this summer.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Just how the three-metre-high by 20-metre-wide melanoma will change colour, as well as its shape and size, will remain an artist’s secret. “We almost want people to not recognise that it’s changed at first,” he says. “We want people to feel like, ‘Oh wow, that changed in front of my eyes, and I didn’t really realise it’ … because that almost feels like how you would recognise a melanoma on your own skin.” The creative team of Hankin, Andy Cooke and Matthew Aberline will be joined by Scott Maggs, who founded Skin Check Champions following the death of his closest friend from skin cancer at the age of 26. According to Cancer Council NSW, two out of three Australians will be diagnosed with some type of skin cancer during their lifetime, and Australia is one of the world leaders in skin cancer research and treatment. Early detection of melanomas is critical, Maggs says. “Over 60% of skin cancers are actually identified by the people who had them on their skin. It’s something really important for every Australian to learn, to look out for changes and things that are new.” Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Skin Check Champions provides free early detection services, including to regional and remote communities, and educates people with the “A, B, C, D, E” mantra – A for asymmetry, B for border, C for colour, D for diameter and E for evolution.

When the exhibition concludes on 4 November, Skin Check Champions will take up a 10-day residency at theBondiSurf Bathers’ life saving club, where it hopes to screen about 2,000 people.

Abortion wasn’t on the Queensland election agenda. So why is it now a threat to the LNP campaign?,,"On front doorsteps in Brisbane’s middle suburbs, Liberal National party candidates campaigning for the upcomingQueenslandelection have started getting questions about abortion. “It’s becoming an issue … in places we thought we might win,” says one party member. Two weeks ago, as the Queensland election campaign began, Labor social media posts suggesting the LNP had a “secret plan” to limit abortion rights and access weredismissed as a scare campaign. The LNP leader,David Crisafulli, says his party has “ruled out” changes to Labor’s 2018 laws that decriminalised abortion. Abortion is, as Crisafulli says, “not a priority” for the LNP. But it has quickly become a problem. What might have started as a last-ditch Labor tactic has now become a mainstream issue, which LNP moderates say is damaging the party’s chances of regaining a footing in more progressive Brisbane electorates. This week the crossbench MP Robbie Katter pledged he would trigger a conscience vote to restrict – and possibly even criminalise – abortion. Crisafulli, whose ticket includes the former Christian right-backed senator Amanda Stoker and other MPs and candidates who are on record opposing abortion, has now been asked about the issue for five straight days. On Wednesday, he batted away 39 separate questions about the issue. Every question gets the same answer. The attempts to deflect are only adding fuel to the fire. Soon after Crisafulli became LNP leader in 2020, he struck a sort of informal stability deal with his party room to put internal fights to one side to bolster the LNP’s chances of taking back government. At the 2020 election, the LNP’s internecine bickering contributed to a weak result. Party members referred to unpopular office bearers – who tried to roll the leader, Deb Frecklington, just weeks before the campaign – as “the cabal”. The party’s identity crisis was writ large in an email from the then president, Cynthia Hardy, who said a review of the 2020 loss would seek to define what the LNP stood for. “What is our raison d’etre?” Hardy asked members. The four-year rebuild has now put the LNP in a position where, according to the polls, it is on the verge of winning government in Queensland. Sources say key to the success has been the informal stability arrangement – MPs from the moderates, conservatives and the Christian right all agreeing to drop their personal crusades and focus on a singular goal. The party found a unifying purpose: beating Labor. “But those divisions are still there, they haven’t gone away” one LNP source says. The shift in the campaign to focus on abortion rights, and the prospect of a conscience vote, serves to highlight those divisions in a way that can cause significant damage to the party, just weeks before voters go to the polls. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The issue is so vexed for the LNP because it divides the party – the majority of its grassroots members, its platform and its MPs – from more progressive views of the electorate. Social reforms such as abortion and voluntary assisted dying have been key to Labor’s electoral success in Queensland, but particularly Brisbane where the LNP holds just four seats. Both of those reforms were progressed cautiously – drafted by the law reform commission and ultimately backed by polling that showed overwhelming support. And Labor has sought to exploit those sorts of social policy debates, knowing they harm the LNP in city areas where the party is eager to re-establish a presence. With the LNP cruising in the polls, moderates had held out hope of beating Labor in middle suburban seats – Ferny Grove, Stafford, Mansfield, Mount Ommaney and Aspley – areas beyond the reach of Greens insurgency, but still places where votes have more “small-l” liberal values. Many of these areas vote for the LNP at local and federal elections but are Labor strongholds in the state parliament. A Labor source says the reality is the state LNP is “way too wacko for Brisbane to stomach”. The added concern for LNP moderates is the potential makeup of the LNP party room after the election, if the party wins regional or city fringe seats but not Brisbane ones. “We need moderates in the next parliament,” one party member says. Party sources say the “Christian soldiers” grouping within the LNP has relatively little influence within the current state parliamentary team. There are really only two hardcore members of the Christian right in the LNP party room – the retiring rightwinger Mark Robinson and the veteran Sunshine Coast MP Fiona Simpson. Others often attributed as being associated with the faction, such as Tim Mander or Christian Rowan, are more neatly aligned with Peter Dutton’s mainstream conservative grouping. But before elections, factions always battle for influence. Robinson is handing his seat to Stoker, the former federal senator and figurehead of the Christian right. Candidates who have won preselection for winnable LNP seats include several who have ahistory of opposing abortion rights, or with links to Pentecostal churches. Particularly concerning to LNP moderates is the recent takeover of a large inner-city party division – and the attempted takeover of another – by the Christian right. The party’s Griffith federal divisional council – covering Queensland’s most progressive federal seat – is now helmed by Alan Baker, a veteran of anti-abortion campaigns in the state. Baker sent apre-election email on party letterheadsaying the government had been “captured by transgender ideology”. “Fringe infiltrators can see an election victory around the corner and are desperate to increase their influence,” an LNP source said at the time Baker won control of the branch. With polls still pointing to a comfortable LNP win, the risk for Crisafulli is that the prospect of a conscience vote – brought about by Katter – serves to highlight internal conflicts that have been paused, rather than solved. The opposition leader won’t say publicly whether he would allow a conscience vote, in line with party convention. The federal MP Colin Boycesaid it would be “extraordinary”not to. Crisafulli’s backers are mostly moderates, and MPs say the opposition has been “remarkably united” during the past term. But they also acknowledge that concern about abortion springs from “legitimate concern about what happens when we get in”. “It’s also difficult because we don’t have a track record to point back to,” the MP says. “We obviously try not to hark back to the Newman years.” In more than three decades, the conservatives have only won one Queensland election. After 2012, the landslide win by Campbell Newman, the LNP quickly became unstuck by factional warfare. The party’s MPs went to war with its organisational wing. The nature of the 2012 landslide also meant the election of new MPs who the party might not have expected to win. A state that voted for Newman, framed as a more moderate Liberal, wound up with a party room that veered more conservative and pushed that agenda in government. Griffith University political scientist and commentator Paul Williams says he expects those sorts of internal issues to come to the fore within 12 months of an LNP election win. “Those things are still there in the background,” he said. LNP figurespredicted Labor attacks about abortionwhen Stoker – who lost her Senate seat in 2022 – was preselected to run in Oodgeroo. Stoker announced herself to the public with a firebrand speech on the Senate floor, describing Queensland’s abortion decriminalisation laws as “barbarism [with] the cloak of civility”. In 2022, she told the Conservative Political Action Conference the Coalition would bein opposition for a “very long time”if it did not focus on conservative social issues. But since being announced as a candidate, Stoker has been uncharacteristically quiet as the LNP attempts to stifle intensifying debate about abortion and other social issues, and instead focus on kitchen-table ones. Her appearances on Sky News and rightwing podcasts and anti-abortion rallies have all been replaced with community breakfasts and visits to small businesses. Asked on Thursday whether she would support changes to Labor’s 2018 abortion laws, Stoker used the party line: “It’s not part of our plan, the LNP has ruled it out.” The LNP’s continued refusal to engage beyond its rehearsed line – that abortion reform is “not part of our plan” – now risks backfiring amid ramping pressure from different sides of the debate. At a pre-election meeting of a conservative Christian group last month, attenders were urged to email, call or speak to candidates and “just ask them the question: how would you vote if abortion came up”. “The fact you say that puts it in their mind that abortion is an election issue,” the forum moderator said. The LNP has not responded to the Australian Christian Lobby’s pre-election survey, which includes questions about abortion. The pro-choice service Children by Choice also sent questions to every state MP asking whether they supported, and would protect, ongoing access to termination of pregnancy. None have responded. “It feels ominous, it’s a scary position,” says Jill McKay, the chief executive officer of Children by Choice. “It’s a very simple question. “We’re not trying to polarise who people vote for, but it is a very deep concern that one of our major political parties is unable to present to Queensland what their policies are. “Women who vote for the LNP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the ALP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the Greens need to access abortion.” LNP sources acknowledge that the Katter plan to bring the issue to the next parliament “fucks us”. “[Crisafulli] needs to come out and say something more definitive,” one party source says. But another warns that sticking to the agreed lines remains the only tactic that could keep the informal stability arrangement in place. “The discipline that this whole campaign has been built on would dissolve in a second,” the source says.",Ben Smee,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-smee,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/queensland-election-2024-lnp-abortion-policy-david-crisafulli
"Stop pushing heat pumps or face major backlash, green energy magnate tells Labour",,"The government risks a huge political backlash if it keeps pushing the public to install heat pumps to replace their boilers, one of Britain’s leading green entrepreneurs has warned. Dale Vince, a major Labour donor and renewable energy advocate, called on Keir Starmer to rethink national programmes,championed by Boris Johnson, pushing the technology. Vince argued that Whitehall should explore alternatives to the devices, which he said were expensive, caused serious disruption and could end up increasing energy bills for some people. Vince, whose criticism of heat pumps has proved divisive among environmentalists, said mass use could bring a bigger political backlash than London’s expanded ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which led to asurprise byelection defeat for Labourlast year in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. “It’s a Johnson-era policy, and like most Johnson ideas, it wasn’t thought through,” Vince said. “It wasn’t meant for the real world, if you look at the amount of money committed. Electricity energy bills overall in our households will go up unless you assume heroic levels of performance. “You’ve got this incredible disruption of home life for tens of millions of people – the need to change heating systems for a lot of people, not just the boiler – and substandard outcomes in a lot of cases.” He added: “It’s politically threatening for any government to have a heat-pump programme. If you look back at the Ulez byelection and the fuss made about it in elements of the press, imagine a heat-pump programme where a household has just spent thousands of pounds on some technology that doesn’t do the job.” In June, Vince tweeted that heat pumps were like “Ulez on steroids”. The entrepreneur’s latest comments expose divides even among environmentalists about the best way to move home heating away from the burning of fossil fuels via a regular gas boiler. Critics such as Vince state that heat pumps could increase bills because the electricity used to run them costs far more than gas. A study by the independent Energy Saving Trust put the cost at£20 a year morethan using a new A-rated gas boiler. However,new specialist heat pump tariffscould make them cheaper to run. Johnson’s government was an advocate of the technology, setting a goal of 600,000 new heat pumps a year by 2028. While installations in the UK have hit a record number this year, they have still only reached about 42,000 since January. Air-source heat pumps cost just over £12,500 to buy and install on average, about four to five times more than a gas boiler. But the government currently offers a £7,500 grant for households installing the technology. Sign up toObserved Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion Vince claimed that he was speaking in the “national interest” in criticising heat pumps. He proposes an alternative –green gas, or biomethane, made from organic material, which his company Ecotricity develops. Other environmentalists claim that the amount of land needed to produce enough green gas would be unrealistic, lead tofood insecurity and damage biodiversity. The Heat Pump Association, an industry body, insisted that the devices are a “proven, efficient, low-carbon heating solution which are readily available and scalable with the potential to reduce carbon emissions from heating by over 75% relative to fossil fuel heating systems”. “Electricity prices are higher than gas prices in the UK,” it said. “However, heat pumps use three to five times less energy. Well-installed heat pumps that operate efficiently and make use of flexible electricity tariffs will in the vast majority of cases save the consumer money in comparison to their existing heating system.” A Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero spokesperson said of Vince’s concerns: “We do not recognise these claims. The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes, and heat pumps are a critical technology for decarbonising heating. “Biomethane also has an important role in the transition to net zero as a green gas that can decarbonise gas supply, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and increase energy security.” Vince also revealed plans to take advantage of the government’s decision toend the effective ban on onshore windby “dusting off” a plan for 100 turbines in Gloucestershire, where his company is based, to power the county’s homes. He said they could ultimately be transferred to the council’s ownership, handing it both an asset and long-term income. “If they were owned by the local authority, the windmills would bring £7m a year into local authority coffers,” he said. “We will take the lead on this. We will find the sites, take them through planning and at some point in the future hope to work with local authorities to hand them over for public ownership.”",Michael Savage,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-savage,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/12/stop-pushing-heat-pumps-backlash-green-energy-magnate-labour-ulez
‘It’s just crazy’: the retired Cornish builder making thousands from his whale paintings,,"A year ago, art gallery owner Tabby Booth was scrolling through eBay when a painting of a whale caught her eye. “I wasn’t even browsing for work,” said Booth, who set up the Sailors Jail gallery in Falmouth,Cornwall, with her husband, James Heslip, in 2023. “It was just for my own interest. But there was something about these whale pictures that felt really special, and the artist was from Newquay. “Our USP as a gallery is to promote Cornish artists so we decided to go and visit him.” They found Steve Camps ensconced in his workshop overlooking the surfer’s paradise of Fistral beach, a retired former builder sitting at the centre of what Booth described as an “Aladdin’s cave” of old picture frames, vintage art and whale paintings. They took away 15 of his distinctive, deceptively simple paintings and put them on sale in the gallery, ranging from £20 for the smaller ones to £100 for the largest. Camps was delighted; he had been happy enough with the few quid he’d got for selling a handful of unsigned pictures online. But the best was yet to come. “Within a week the paintings had all gone,” said Booth. “We had to get more from him, and we knew we had to put the prices up.” A year later, people can’t get enough of Camps’s whales. He does a drop of new paintings about once a month to Sailors Jail, which exclusively sells his work for about £2,500 a piece. Booth now acts as his agent. By the time last weekend’s batch had been hung in the gallery and priced, they had all sold online and had to be taken down again. Camps is slightly flummoxed by it all, not least by the prices his paintings are fetching. It’s a decent unexpected pension, to say the least, for a man who had never put brush to canvas before he retired. “I think I’ve had about £140,000 so far,” he said, sounding as if he hardly believes it himself. Camps has no formal art training. He left school at 16 to become a painter and decorator, and later became a builder, working around Newquay, which he did until retirement. In fact, he’d never even shown an interest in painting. “I suppose I’ve always been a bit of a collector,” he said. “Stamps, things like that, but I never really found the thing that grabbed me until I found some old paintings by a local artist, and bought them on the spur of the moment.” Camps slowly amassed a collection of largely unknown artists, sometimes selling them on through local auction houses, more often just keeping and restoring the frames in his workshop. When he retired at the beginning of last year, he and his partner, Sue, embarked upon a series of coach holidays across the UK. In Llandudno, north Wales, he saw two paintings in the window of a charity shop. “They were quite unusual in style,” he said. “They were ships, they must have been whaling ships, because there were whales on the back of them.” The pictures stirred something in Camps, and when he got home he sat down in his workshop and started to paint. He didn’t even have any proper art materials or paint. “I just used normal emulsion, which I still do,” he said. “I was quite pleased with the results and decided to put them in the vintage frames I had, and stuck them on eBay with some other paintings I’d bought. I think I made about £120, which I was more than happy with.” Last month’s pay cheque for his art was in the region of £20,000, with paintings selling across the world, especially in the US. Camps, who has three children and three grandchildren said: “It’s just crazy. I honestly can’t get my head around it.” Booth is, of course, equally delighted. “He’s basically an authentic outsider artist, with no training, no connections in the art world,” she said. “His work has naiveté and character.

"Al Pacino on the inside story of The Godfather: ‘I was told, you’re not cutting it’",,"One day in the middle of the afternoon, I got a phone call. On the other end of the line, I heard the name and the voice of the director who would change my life:Francis Ford Coppola. First, he told me he was going to be directing The Godfather. I thought he might be fantasising. What was he talking about? How did they give him The Godfather? I had read Mario Puzo’s novel, which had become a big hit; it was a huge deal for anyone to be involved with it. But when you’re a young actor you don’t even put your eyes on those things. Just getting any part in a film is a miracle. Opportunities like those don’t exist for you. It just seemed so outrageous. And then I thought: Hey, maybe this is possible. I had spent time with Francis in San Francisco. He was a leader, a doer and a risk taker. I saw that he carried himself with confidence, and that gave me faith in him. But this wasn’t a thing that was done at the time. Wouldn’t the studio, Paramount, go to older directors who had reputations, not this talented, young avant-garde intellectual? It didn’t fit with my perception of Hollywood. Then Francis said he wanted me to play Michael Corleone. I thought, Now he’s gone too far. I started doubting whether he was on the phone at all. Maybe I was the one going through a nervous breakdown. For a director to offer you a role, over the phone, not through an agent or anything, and this role of all roles – that was a hundred-million-to-one shot. Who was I, to have this fall into my lap? When I finally hung up the phone with Francis, I was kind of in a daze. Paramount didn’t want me to play Michael Corleone. They wanted Jack Nicholson. They wanted Robert Redford. They wanted Warren Beatty or Ryan O’Neal. In the book, Puzo had Michael calling himself “the sissy of the Corleone family”. He was supposed to be small, dark-haired, handsome in a delicate way, no visible threat to anybody. That didn’t sound like the guys that the studio wanted. But that didn’t mean it had to be me. It did mean, however, that I would have to screen-test for the role, which I had never done before, and that I would have to fly out to the west coast to do it, which I just didn’t want to do. I did not care that it wasThe Godfather. I was a bit afraid of flying and I didn’t want to go to California. But my manager, Marty Bregman, said to me, “You’re getting on that fucking plane.” He brought me a pint of whiskey so I could drink it on the flight, and I got there. Paramount had already rejected Francis’s entire cast. They rejectedJimmy CaanandBob Duvall, who were great established actors, well on their way to what they would become. They rejectedBrando, for Christ’s sake. It was quite clear walking into the studio that they didn’t want me either. And I knew I wasn’t the only one being considered. Many of the young actors of the day were reading for Michael. That was an unpleasant feeling. Before I even did my screen test, Francis took me to a barber in San Francisco, because he wanted Michael to have an authentic 1940s haircut. The barber heard that we were making the film and actually stepped back, took it in, and started shaking. We found out later that he had a heart attack. Word was out that there was a lot riding on this film behind the scenes. Paramount executives were irate with one another and having shouting matches. You could feel the tension everywhere. So I did my Zen “this too shall pass” thing. I said to myself, Go to the character. What is going on in the scene? Where are you going? Where did you come from? Why are you here? I sat through a few days’ worth of screen tests wearing an early version of Michael’s army uniform and a hangdog expression on my face. I always had that look. I guess it was a facade that I carried with me, because it got me through everything. But I must say the scene I was asked to do was not the best one they could have picked. It was Michael, in the opening wedding scene, explaining to his girlfriend, Kay, what his family really did and who all the players were in his father’s operation. It was a mundane scene of exposition, just me andDiane Keatonsitting at a drab little table, drinking glasses of water we pretended were wine, while I talked about Sicilian wedding customs. My interpretation of Michael was like planting a garden; it would take a certain amount of time in the story for the flowers to grow. How am I supposed to bring across my ideas about him in this scene? I couldn’t bring him to life in this scene because nobody could. But here’s the secret: Francis wanted me. He wanted me and I knew that. And there’s nothing like when a director wants you. He also gave me a gift in the form of Diane Keaton. He had a few actors he was auditioning for the role of Kay, but the fact that he wanted to pair me up with Diane suggested she had an edge in the process. I knew she was doing well in her career and had been appearing on Broadway in shows like Hair and Play It Again, Sam with Woody Allen. A few days before the screen test, I met Diane in Lincoln Center in New York City at a bar, and we just hit it off. She was easy to talk to and funny, and she thought I was funny too. I felt like I had a friend and an ally right away. When I knew I had the role for sure, I called my grandmother to tell her. “You know I’m going to be in The Godfather? I’m going to play the part of Michael Corleone.” She said, “Oh, Sonny, listen! Grandad was born in Corleone, that’s where he was from.” I didn’t know where my grandfather was born, only that he came from Sicily – once my grandfather got to America and no one was chasing after him, he left it at that. Now to learn he came from Corleone, the very town that gave my character and his family their name? I thought, I must be getting help from somewhere, because how else could such an impossible thing – me getting the role – happen in the first place? I still had to figure out who Michael was to me. Before filming started, I would take long walks up and down Manhattan, from 91st Street to the Village and back, just thinking about how I was going to play him. Mostly I’d go alone, other times I’d meet my friend Charlie Laughton downtown and we’d walk back uptown together. Michael starts out from a young man we’ve seen before, getting by, a little loopy, a little lumpy. He’s there and not there at the same time. It’s all building up to when he volunteers to take out Virgil Sollozzo and Capt McCluskey, the drug dealer and the crooked cop who conspired to kill Vito Corleone, Michael’s father. All of a sudden, there’s a big explosion in him. This is mapped out in the novel, because a book can give the narrative as much time as it needs. You wait and see how it unfolds. But what was I going to do in the film? Before we started shooting, I got together with Little Al Lettieri, who was going to play Sollozzo. He just said to me, “You should meet this guy. It’s good for what you’re doing.” I sort of knew what he meant by that, so I went along with him. One day we took a drive to a suburb just outside the city. Little Al brought me to a traditional, beautiful, well-kept home. He took me inside and introduced me to the head of the household, a guy who looked like a normal businessman. I shook his hand and said hello, and he was very welcoming. He had a loving family. He had a wife who served us drinks and light snacks on fine porcelain. He had two young sons around my age. I was just some crazy actor who had come into his house, trying to absorb as much as I could. Our conversation remained polite and at the surface level. I never asked Little Al why he had brought me here, but I thought about what he had said before we came, how this visit would be helpful for what I was working on. Little Al knew some guys. Some real guys. And now he was introducing me to one of them. I was being given a taste of how this thing looked and operated in reality, not how it was shown in the movies. Not that our host was going to get into any of those details with us. As a matter of fact, we ended up drinking and playing games. Many moons later, photos from that night surfaced, showing me in a sweatshirt, laughing away with a drink in my hand, while Little Al showed me a gun. A boys’ night out. I was a kid from the South Bronx. I am an Italian. I am a Sicilian too. I knew what it was to always be assumed that you had at least a connection to organised crime. Any name that ended with a vowel was scrutinised for having possible connections to that world. Instead of being compared to Joe DiMaggio, you were associated with Al Capone. Most of us will never experience crime, let alone perpetrate it. And yet we’re fascinated with these people who are determined not to live within the rules of society, who are finding another way to go. The outlaw is a particularly American kind of character. We grew up pretending to be Jesse James and Billy the Kid. These were folk heroes. They became part of our lore. The history of the mafia is part of that lore too. My filming on the Godfather began with its opening wedding sequence, which took about a week out in Staten Island. From my humble day-to-day life, I found myself plunged into the set of a huge Hollywood film, filled with equipment, hot lights and dolly tracks, cranes and booms, microphones hovering overhead, and a company of actors with hundreds of extras, all working under Francis’s direction. Diane and I spent those first days laughing with each other, having to perform that opening wedding exposition scene from the screen test that we hated so much. On the basis of just that one scene, we were certain we were in the worst picture ever made, and when we’d finish shooting for the day, we would go back to Manhattan and get drunk. Our careers were over, we thought. Back in Hollywood, Paramount started to look at the film that Francis had shot, and they were once again questioning whether I was the right actor for the part. The rumour had got out around the set that I was going to be let go from the picture. You could feel that loss of momentum when we shot. There was a discomfort among people, even the crew, when I was working. I was very conscious of that. The word was that I was going to be fired, and, likely, so was the director. Not that Francis wasn’t cutting it – I wasn’t. But he was the one responsible for me being in the film. Finally, Francis determined that something had to be done. One night he called me to meet him at the Ginger Man, a restaurant and watering hole for thirsty Lincoln Center types, where actors, dancers, maestros, and stagehands all lined up at the bar. He was having dinner there with his wife, his kids and a small group, and when I went in and found him at his table, he said, “Listen, I want to talk to you a minute.” He didn’t invite me to sit down with them. I stood there wondering, What’s he doing? He’s cutting his steak and looking at me like I’m not part of anything – like I’m just some isolated actor who had come looking for a handout. Finally, Francis said, “You know how much you mean to me, how much faith I had in you.” At this point we had been shooting The Godfather for about a week and a half. And Francis said, “Well, you’re not cutting it.” I felt that one in the pit of my stomach. It’s when it finally hit me that my job was on the line. I said to Francis, “What do we do here?” He said, “I put together rushes of what we’ve shot already. Why don’t you take a look at it yourself? Because I don’t think it’s working. You’re not working.” I went into a screening room the next day. And when I looked at the footage, all scenes from very early in the film, I thought to myself, I don’t think there’s anything spectacular here. I didn’t know what to make of it. But the effect was certainly what I wanted. I didn’t want to be seen. My whole plan for Michael was to show that this kid was unaware of things and wasn’t coming on with a personality that was particularly full of charisma. My idea was that this guy comes out of nowhere. That was the power of this characterization. That was the only way this could work: the emergence of this person, the discovery of his capacity and his potential. By the end of the film, I hoped that I would have created an enigma. And I think that’s what Francis was hoping for also. But neither one of us knew how to explain it to the other.

The jury’s out on whether he did that deliberately, and Francis himself has denied that he orchestrated it for my benefit, but he did move up the filming of the Italian restaurant scene, where the untested Michael comes to take his revenge on Sollozzo and McCluskey. That scene was not meant to be filmed until a few days later, but if something hadn’t happened to let me show what I was capable of, there might not have been a later for me. So over the course of an April night I shot that scene. I spent 15 hours that day in a tiny restaurant, with Little Al Lettieri and the magnificent Sterling Hayden, who played McCluskey. The two of them truly were precious to me. They knew I was going through a difficult time, feeling like I had the world on my shoulders, knowing that any day the axe could fall on me. Here we were in a dead, fetid room that was being filled with smoke and hellish heat – we had no trailers to escape to, no production assistants coming up and asking, “Can we get you some water?” None of that. I was just sitting there, thinking, How do you stand this stuff? The absolute ennui of it could actually kill you. Sterling and Al Lettieri helped keep up my morale; they set a tone and were role models for me. But eventually the script called for me to excuse myself to use the bathroom, find a hidden gun, and blow their brains out. Then I had to run out of the restaurant and make my escape by jumping on to a moving car. I had no stand-in. I had no stuntman. I had to do it myself. I jumped, and I missed the car. Now I was lying in a gutter on White Plains Road in the Bronx, flat on my back and looking up at the sky. I had twisted my ankle so badly that I couldn’t move. Everyone on the crew had crowded around me. They were trying to lift me up, asking me: Was my ankle broken? Could I walk? I didn’t know. I lay there thinking, This is a miracle. Oh God, you’re saving me. I don’t have to do this picture any more. I was shocked by the feeling of relief that passed over me. Showing up for work every day, feeling unwanted, feeling like an underling, was an oppressive experience, and this injury could be my release from that prison. At least now they could fire me, recast another actor as Michael, and not lose every dime they’d already put into the picture. But that’s not what happened. They filmed the rest of the car-jumping scene with a stunt guy who appeared out of nowhere, and they shot my ankle up with cortisone until I could stand on my feet again. Then Francis showed the restaurant scene to the studio, and when they looked at it, something was there. Because of that scene I just performed, they kept me in the film. So I didn’t get fired from The Godfather. I just kept doing what I did, what I had thought about on those lonely walks up and down the length of Manhattan. I did have a plan, a direction that I really believed was the way to go with this character. And I was certain that Francis felt the same way. Ihad been introduced toMarlon Brandobriefly at a dinner with all the cast members before we started filming. Now, as we were getting ready to do the scene where Michael finds Vito in the hospital, Francis said, “Why don’t you and Brando have lunch together?” This was going to be the big talk. I actually didn’t want to talk to him. I thought it was not necessary. The discomfort I felt at just the thought of it – You mean I have to have lunch with him? Seriously, it fucking scared me. He was the greatest living actor of our time. I grew up on actors like him – larger than life people like Clark Gable and Cary Grant. They were famous when fame meant something, before the bloom went off the rose. But Francis said you have to and so I did. I had my lunch with Marlon in a modest room in the hospital where we were filming on 14th Street. He was sitting on one hospital bed, I was sitting on the other. He was asking me questions: Where am I from? How long have I been an actor? And he was eating chicken cacciatore with his hands. His hands were full of red sauce. So was his face. And that’s all I could think about the whole time. Whatever his words were, my conscious mind was fixated by the stain-covered sight in front of me. He was talking – gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble – and I was just mesmerised. What was he going to do with the chicken? I hoped he wasn’t going to tell me to throw it in the garbage for him. He disposed of it somehow without getting up. He looked at me in a quizzical way, as if to ask, What are you thinking about? I was wondering, What is he going to do with his hands? Should I get him a napkin? Before I could, he spread both his hands across the white hospital bed and smeared the sheets with red sauce, without even thinking about it, and he kept on talking. And I thought, Is that how movie stars act? You can do anything. When our lunch was over, Marlon looked at me with those gentle eyes of his and said, “Yeah, kid, you’re gonna be all right.” I was taught to be polite and grateful, so I probably just said thank you to him. I was too scared to say anything at all. What I should have said was “Can you define ‘all right’?” What I think audiences received from The Godfather, what brought it across and really gave it its impact, was this idea of family. People identified with the Corleones, saw themselves somehow in them, and found themselves connecting to the characters and their dynamics as brothers and sisters, parents and children. The film had Mario Puzo’s exciting drama and storytelling, the magic of Coppola’s interpretation, and real violence. But in the context of that family, it all became something else. It wasn’t just people from the city who related to the Corleones – that sense of familiarity carried the film to every part of the world. Marlon showed me generosity, too, but I don’t think he saved it all for me, because he shared it with the audience. It’s what made his performance so memorable and so endearing. We all fantasise about having someone like Don Vito we can turn to. So many people are abused in this life, but if you’ve got a Godfather, you’ve got someone you can go to, and they will take care of it. That’s why people responded to him in the film. It was more than just the bravado and the boldness; it was the humanity underneath it. That’s why he had to play Vito larger than life – his physical size, the shoe polish in his hair, the cotton in his cheeks. His Godfather had to be an icon, and Brando made him as iconic as Citizen Kane or Superman, Julius Caesar or George Washington. But Francis had a lot on his shoulders, as I would learn when we were working on the funeral sequence for Vito. It was a big scene we shot out on Long Island that involved a large amount of the cast and took a couple of days. The sun was going down and I heard “Wrap! Wrap!” They told me I was done for the day. So naturally I’m happy because I get to go home and have some fun, whatever that means. I was on the way to my trailer saying to myself, Well, I didn’t fuck up too much. I had no lines, no obligations, and that was fine. As I was heading back, I began to hear the sound of someone crying, which you sort of expect in a graveyard. I looked around to see where it was coming from. And there, sitting on a tombstone, was Francis Ford Coppola bawling like a baby. Profusely crying. Nobody was going near him, so I went up to him, and I said, “Francis, what’s wrong? What happened?” He wiped his eyes with his sleeve, paused, looked up at me, and said, “They won’t give me another shot.” He had wanted to film another setup that day, and he had not been allowed it. Even he had to answer to someone else. And he wanted this so badly that to have it denied had actually wounded him. One never knows if a film is going to be great. But there in that graveyard I thought, If this is the kind of passion that Francis has for it, then something here is working. I knew I was in good hands. Before the Godfather had its premiere in New York, I had seen it only once, a few months earlier, when Francis had shown me an unfinished cut. At the end of that screening, I gave Francis notes on my performance, and he looked at me with an expression of quasi-disgust. Of course when I’m looking at an unfinished film, I can’t help seeing things that I might do differently. But you’d think I would understand that it was not my place to say this to the director of the film, who had just spent the last year of his life dangling from the edge of a cliff by his fingernails to get it made. I was insensitive: he had the grace to show it to me and I came in worried about my performance and not the great film he had made. Sometimes you’re a little unconscious as a young actor. You have other things on your mind, and all forms of grace and etiquette go out the window due to your vain impulses and stupid ego. I’ve seen it in others, I must say. I hope I’m not still that way, but the jury’s out on that one. Back in 1972, the effect that the film’s release had on me was immediate. It happened at light speed. Everything changed. A few weeks after it came out, I was walking on the street and a middle-aged woman came up to me and kissed my hand and called me “Godfather”. Another time, I went into a grocery store to get a container of coffee to go while Charlie waited for me outside on the sidewalk. And a woman approached him and asked, “Is thatAl Pacino?” He said to her, “Yeah.” She said, “Oh, really? He’s Al Pacino?” He said to her, “Well, somebody’s gotta be.” The film had not been out that long, so I continued to go about my normal daily life as if nothing had changed. One day I was standing at a kerb, waiting for the light to change, and this pretty redhead was standing there with me. I looked at her. She looked at me. I said, “Hi.” She said, “Hi, Michael.” And I just went, Whoa. Oh my God. I am not safe. Anonymity, sweet pea, the light of my life, my survival tool – that’s gone now.

"A week in a swing state taught me a lot about the Maga cult, and gave me hope for Kamala Harris",,"To attend a Trump rally in rural America makes you worry for humanity’s future. After six hours in the baking sun watching 60,000-plus Trump supporters lap up his lies, I am here to tell you that there are few more lowering experiences to be had in modern politics. But it isn’t all we have, and there is much of a positive nature to report from the US, including aninspiring interventionfrom Barack Obama last week and the truth that the Democrat candidate for presidency, Kamala Harris, is conducting a very good campaign indeed. Given that she’s had just three months to pick her running mate, coordinate strategy and key messaging, and confront a wretchedly divided nation, she’s performing with grace and steadiness, while the campaign has united around building a coalition with disaffected Republicans and conservatives of conscience who were in Congress or the Trump administration. For the first time since July, when Harris became the Democrat candidate, theNew York Times/Siena College pollshows her leading Trumpby three points, 49-46. In the average maintained byThe Hillwebsite she is showing a lead of 3.4. Sure, both are within the margin of error and the contest in the seven swing states is much tighter, but the trends are in her favour. She is improving on the key issues of economy and migration and is becoming the candidate of change. A persistent Maga attack line over the last months was that she was too scared, ignorant or dumb to do interviews. She answered it by sitting down with Alex Cooper’sCallHer Daddypodcast, giving a fascinatinginterview to Howard Stern’s radio show, sharing a beer with Stephen Colbert on his late-night show, and announcing, on Whoopi Goldberg’sThe Viewthat, if she won,Medicare would pay for home care. Finally, she faced the remorseless Bill Whitaker in the60 Minutesinterview, an October ordeal for presidential candidates for the last 50 years. She carried herself well and was never less than poised.As I wrote in this paper, I once spent a few hours with her at a social event and liked her a lot but, after seeing those five shows, I feel a duty to note that she can be extraordinarily slippery when it comes to answering questions. Yet she is abiding by all the rules of the democratic game, unlike Donald Trump who refuses to engage in the process and tours his own rallies, ranting and lying, and looking somehow more lumpen and angrier than ever before. Naturally, hepulled out of the60 Minutesinterview, first saying that he didn’t want to be fact checked, then demanding an apology from his previous interviewer Lesley Stahl for something she hadn’t done. There was a fuss about the edit of the Harris programme, which Maga claimed showed the vice-president in a favourable light – it didn’t – but before that got traction the news moved on with two newspaper articles. TheNew York Timesran a story loggingTrump’s mental decline, then, seemingly to prove its point, Trump took himself to the swing state of Michigan last Thursday andtrashed the city of Detroitin a speech to, yes, the Detroit Economic Club. TheWashington Postpublished exclusives from Bob Woodward’s new bookWarthat revealed thatTrump sent Covid tests to Putinand had spoken to him from Mar-a-Lago, the country club where he was alleged to have kept stolen secret documents in a bathroom. The mostdelightful revelationwas a quote from Republican senator Lindsey Graham. “Going to Mar-a-Lago is like being in North Korea. Everybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.” One further positive note. Harris has pulled in over $1bn in campaign donations and is outspending Trump on social media, which is smart because 16 million young people have joined the electorate since 2020.Latest figures showshe’s spent $57m with Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, to Trump’s $6m, and on Google, owner of YouTube, $31.5m compared with Trump’s $9.3m. I spent the week in the state of Pennsylvania, which is the epicentre of the race because it has 19 electoral college votes – the most of any swing state. If a candidate wins by just a handful of individual ballots, he or she will take all the state’s 19 electoral college votes, and probably go on to win the White House. The race is effectively tied and both candidates are putting enormous effort into the state. Trump appeared there twice last week, most theatrically at a big rally in the western town of Butler, 35 miles from Pittsburgh, and where he was winged by a would-be assassin three months ago. It was atriumphant return, with much fanfare and many turns and speakers, including JD Vance and a goofy-looking Elon Musk in “dark” Maga cap. Halfway between a revivalist meeting and a country fair, the event told me a lot about the Maga cult but nothing about politics or Trump’s plans (Project 2025is never mentioned). However, I did establish the truth of rumours that hundreds of people leave his rallies as soon as he starts speaking. Last Wednesday, the splendidly principled conservative politician Liz Cheney, who appeared briefly with Harris on60 Minutesafter endorsing her, hosted a session at Glenside, Pennsylvania, with three female former staffers in the Trump White House who provided insights into Trump’s character and the chaos he brought to every issue and situation. This was peripheral to the main campaign but the impact of coherent and respectedRepublicansspeaking against Trump may bring critical votes to Harris. Every vote matters. “Don’t boo,” Obama routinely says, “Vote!” Sign up toObserved Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion Obama made his first appearance for Harris in Pittsburgh, last Thursday, reclaiming the territory in western Pennsylvania from the Trump rally five days before. The speech was among the best he’s ever given, ranking among his appeals to the American public during the 2008 presidential campaign and the wonderful acceptance speech I saw him make in Chicago. Heteased Trump remorselessly, mocking his lies, the obsession with money, power and status and his “concepts of a plan”. He imagined Trump doing something normal like changing a tyre or a nappy. Someone in the audience shouted out, “his own”. Obama smiled and said he’d thought of that joke but resisted the temptation. This drives Trump and Maga to distraction because, like all those with fascist leanings, they cannot stand people making fun of them. Humour will be an important weapon in the next 23 days because the Democrats need to get under his skin and provoke him to show his truly toxic, bullying nature. Obama’s speech was important for its moral indignation, and it may just be the start of national rejection of Trump’s lies, a kind of have-you-no-sense-of-decency moment that recalls the time in 1954 when a lawyer namedJoseph Welch stood up to Joe McCarthyand ended his communist witch-hunt. It could be that Trump and Maga have overreached themselves with their lies about emergency funding afterHurricane Heleneripped through the south-west causing destruction and hundreds of deaths; in one case a family of 11 was wiped out in a mudslide. According to Obama: “Donald Trump just started making up stories about the Biden administration withholding aid from Republican areas and siphoning off aid to give to immigrants… you’ve got a guy who lies to score political points. I want to ask Republicans out there, when did that become OK? Why would we go along with that?” Obama is practically the only person in America who has the moral authority to make this speech. He and his wife, Michelle, are still the most popular and trusted public figures in the country. Republicans will listen to him because, despite the last nine years, ideas of decency and service still have a potent appeal here. What do I think will happen? I agree with the Democrat activist I met in Philadelphia who said: “We’re winning, but we haven’t won yet.” It’s all to play for and in Harris theDemocratshave an authentic and tireless candidate who would do the best job she could in the White House. But let me just warn that even if she wins on 5 November, Trump will not accept defeat. There is evidence that Republicans are building a case to challenge the result by manipulating the late polls in his favour so that any Democrat victory looks like a steal. There will be months of dispute, agonising waits and, I am afraid, intolerable anxiety for us all. But, as Obama says: “We gotta keep hoping.” Henry Porter is a writer and journalist specialising in liberty and civil rights",Henry Porter,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/henryporter,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/12/a-week-in-a-swing-state-taught-me-a-lot-about-the-maga-cult-and-gave-me-hope-for-kamala-harris-pennsylvania

If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?I had rushed to make 7pm because of parking issues and must have seemed flustered. That’s what I would change, because Chloe seemed very relaxed. Marks out of 10?A solid 9. Would you meet again?Probably ... What were you hoping for?Thunderbolts and lightning! Or at least, a fun evening. First impressions?Tall, handsome, smiley. What did you talk about?Books. Poems. Politics. Travels. I was fascinated to hear about Rashpal’s work in prisons. We disagreed on whether Leonardo DiCaprio makes a good Romeo … Of course he does! Most awkward moment?I can be very nosy, so maybe I asked one or two questions that were overly direct. Good table manners?Excellent. He shared his pudding with me, and his pot of tea. Best thing about Rashpal?He is full of enthusiasm and has a vivid way of describing his experiences. Would you introduce Rashpal to your friends?Of course. Rashpal would enliven any social occasion. Describe Rashpal in three wordsWholehearted, genuine and open. What do you think he made of you?Curious and determined to enjoy myself (I didn’t hold back on the martinis). Did you go on somewhere?We lingered in the restaurant until we were the only people left and then I had to dash for the last train. And … did you kiss?The vibe felt more friendly than romantic – although I believe friendly is a fine place to begin. So a warm hug and a kiss on the cheek. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?Nothing – the food was delicious and the company fantastic. Marks out of 10?I can’t think of a reason not to award a 10.

The moment I knew: he hid his emotions – but after a week apart he said ‘I missed you’,,"Dean and I met in 1967 at the University of Adelaide when we were 18 years old and in the second year of our science degrees. We worked back to back in the biochemistry laboratory. I soon discovered to my delight that he was on top of the subject and could answer my questions. I remember thinking: “This man is smart, and useful.” Soon I would “accidentally” come across him at the cafeteria, library and bookshop. Eventually he asked me out but we only dated for a few months. There was no drama. We drifted apart. He told me later he found me too frivolous; I found him too serious. Fast forward two years and we were both studying for our honours. We began running into each other late at night in the library and we fell back into comfortable conversation. My mother noticed that he was being mentioned more often and invited him to my 21st birthday party. He looked so handsome at the door holding a big bunch of flowers, and got on so easily with my friends. As he climbed into his car to leave, he asked me out to the movies. A week later we were early to the movie session, so we window-shopped. We talked and talked; he had such wide interests. Every time he spoke I learned something. He was kind and quietly self-confident and I sensed a gentle strength about him. He wasn’t as serious as I thought. I could make him laugh – the ultimate compliment. I was filled with joy. I didn’t want the window-shopping to end. That night he took me to see Charly, with Cliff Robertson; later, it was2001: A Space Odyssey. Maybe it was a test since science fiction was one of his passions. If so, I passed. Being with Dean was so intellectually stimulating. He opened up new worlds for me. I began to work through his science fiction library. I’d have dinner with his family and then we’d both retire to his bedroom and shut the door – to listen to classical music. The family said later they wondered what we were doing. Beethoven! We shared an interest in astronomy and combined our meagre savings to buy a telescope. He understood the scientific and technical aspects; I knew my way around the sky and could show himSaturn’s rings. His main hobby was shell collecting, and his idea of the perfect date was us crawling on our stomachs along the beach, looking for tiny shells. It became my favourite activity. We became inseparable. Dean was reserved, independent and hid his emotions. I didn’t expect declarations of undying love. About three months into our relationship, he went away to a week-long science conference – I told him I’d miss him. His reply: “I’m going to have a good time.” I met the bus when he returned, waiting excitedly at the stop late at night. As he came down the bus steps, I realised he looked a little pale and seedy. We hugged. Then as we turned to leave he said, “I missed you”, not looking at me, not in a romantic way but almost defiant. How dare I get under his skin! How dare I force him to express an emotion! I took a moment to process what he’d said and then the words hit me like a thunderbolt. That’s when I knew he loved me. And he’d broken through a hangover to express it. He was never going to get rid of me after that. We went back to our respective homes and I think he must have slept well but I was possessed by a happy restlessness. We married in 1971 (I asked him) and have been together for 53 years. What I didn’t perhaps appreciate at first was Dean’s kindness, patience, respect for others and loyalty. His calmness balanced my more outgoing personality. He did half the housework and eventually took over the cooking. He was a hands-on parent to our daughter from the start, changing nappies and comforting a restless baby all night. This was not so common for men in the 1970s! He nursed me through two bouts of breast cancer. Older people called on him to help with odd jobs and computer wrangling. Of course we sometimes clashed. I was neat and he was messy. He was cautious, I was more impulsive. We were both stubborn but we learned to say “sorry” and mean it. Most of all, we had such fun. Love is knowing there’s always someone who’s on your side. It’s been a life of adventure, travel, learning and sharing. We loved the outdoors. We studied and wrote about nature, and spread the conservation message. We’ve experienced ancient fossil sites, active volcanoes and the Arctic tundra; camped alone in a vast red desert, hiked the Rocky Mountains, and journeyed to places in Kyoto mentioned in ancient Japanese literature. After retiring from our science careers, I worked on the moth collection in Museums Victoria. Dean was down the corridor working on shells. I’m now the only one who carries these memories. Dean has severe dementia and is in a home. When I visit he recognises me occasionally. Then he smiles and takes my hand. We walk in the garden of the home and, as always, our love for the outdoors brings us together. Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

This is how we do it: ‘We’ve rediscovered the lust of our teenage years in our 60s’,,"Henry is the first person I’ve slept with since my husband of 34 years. We had a happy relationship – three sons and a good sex life. After he died a few years ago it was like I’d lost all desire for sex. I had no interest, but felt sad that a part of myself that I’d enjoyed was gone. In February this year I decided I was too young for that to be my final relationship, so I downloaded a dating app. I wasn’t expecting much, but then I saw Henry’s profile. He’d lost his wife and had three sons, like me. We met at a wine bar and had a strong connection. He invited me to his place. I said mine was closer. I had never slept with anyone on a first date – not even my husband. I was nervous. Would it be awkward? Would he need Viagra? Would I have issues with lubrication? I had saggy parts, and I felt overweight and vulnerable. But it was lovely. We kissed on the sofa, and then went to the bedroom. We’ve been seeing each other for six months now, usually every weekend and once during the week. I enjoy the ritual of getting ready when he comes over on a Friday night. I take a long shower, put on lotion – all those things that when you’re married for a long time, you don’t tend to do. We have sex several times a night, and I always have a lot of orgasms, which is new for me. I’m much more open with him than I was even with my husband. I think I was more reserved in the past. Early on, we talked a little bit about our sex lives with our spouses. Fairly quickly, I decided I didn’t want to do that: when he talked about his late wife I couldn’t help but make comparisons; I also didn’t want to have grief come into this wonderful new relationship. Grief has changed me. I’m much more in the moment than I ever was. I was always the good person: taking care of my kids and my parents, and working hard. Now I think, what the hell: let’s have sex on the first night, let’s have sex all Sunday morning. Why not? I’ve learned that life is fleeting. Henry makes me happy and the sex makes me happy, so why not have fun? I remember, after my first night with Grace, thinking to myself: wow, welcome back to the land of the living. It had been a hard few years. My wife died in 2022 – we’d been together for 35 years. She knew for the last nine months that she didn’t have long left. After about a year alone I started to think, “Maybe I’m ready to meet someone else”. I made a dating profile in February. Grace messaged me within a few days. Grace told me some of her friends thought she was crazy, taking me home on the first date, but it felt reasonable. I did think: should I get some Viagra? But it turned out to not be a problem. We started slowly and after half an hour it was really good. It’s been six months now. We have agreed that we don’t want to live together. I think living apart makes things exciting. Every time I’m going to see her, I get a feeling of anticipation and nervousness. It feels that, at the age of sixtysomething, we’ve had the opportunity to start again, with the lust of our teenage years, but all the wisdom we’ve acquired since. We have sex a lot: three or four times a day. We’ll start off on the sofa and then head for the bedroom. I’ve been amazed at how natural it has all been. Before meeting my late wife, my dating life was unsatisfying. But I think having had a long, very successful relationship gave me confidence that I hadn’t had before. It makes me really happy having Grace around. I think about her a lot when I’m not with her. And the sex, apart from being really enjoyable, reassures me that I’m not dead yet. When you reach our age, you’ve got a choice: you either start slowing down and getting old or you have to head off in a different direction. This feels like that: an entirely new chapter of my life – maybe even a new book. Would you and your partner like to share the story, anonymously, of your sex life?",Kate Lloyd,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-lloyd,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/12/this-is-how-we-do-it-weve-rediscovered-the-lust-of-our-teenage-years-in-our-60s
"The anonymous, anything-goes forum at the heart of the Pelicot rape case",,"The trial of a 71-year-old man has gripped France and horrified the world after he admitted to repeatedly drugging his wife and, over the course of decades, soliciting dozens of men online to rape her while she was unconscious.Dominique Pelicot’s confessions as well as the public bravery of his wife Gisèle have forced a nationwide reckoning over sexual assault and the double lives people lead through the internet. As a court in Avignon has heard Pelicot’s case andallegations against 50 other defendantsover the last several weeks, a pattern has emerged of men who lived publicly upstanding lives while allegedly engaging in abhorrent acts online and in private. As the men accused of mass rape have taken the stand, they have detailed how Pelicot found them and coordinated his abuse on an illicit chat forum called Coco. What has emerged during the trial is that the scale of Pelicot’s crimes and his ability to keep them concealed for so many years would seemingly not have been possible without Coco and its administrators’ disregard for the content being shared on the platform. The site has become one of the starkest examples in memory of how platforms can result in extreme harm when left unmoderated. Since its founding in 2003, Coco has been implicated in killings, pedophilia, homophobic attacks and sexual assaults as it evaded accountability and led law enforcement on an international manhunt. When European authorities finally shut down Coco earlier this year and arrested its founder along with other executives, the website had been cited in more than 23,000 reports of criminal activity and more than 480 victims had been involved in judicial proceedings involving the site, according to French prosecutors. Founded by the software engineer Isaac Steidl while he was in his early 20s, Coco launched as a free chat site with a simple interface allowing users to communicate anonymously. Although the site asked users to confirm that they were over 18, they could quickly change their age once they gained access to the platform and chat with an invented username. “It looked so innocent. It was this very 90s design, with coconut trees and a smiley face and it said “this is a website for nice people,” said Sophie Antoine, an officer for legal advocacy at the French anti-child prostitution organization ACPE. “But you went in, and it was like a jungle.” Users would encounter a public landing page once registered to the site, which featured a list of different chat forums dedicated to different subjects. The sexualized nature of the site meant that many of these forums were dedicated to specific fetishes or contained explicit content. People could also enter private chats on Coco and directly message other users, which one French journalistpretending to be a 15-year-old girlon the site found resulted in a flood of people soliciting them for sex and sending nude images. “It was very accessible and very explicit – there was no control over it,” Antoine said. Although it never gained mainstream popularity, the site became well known among child safety advocates and LGBTQ+ rights groups monitoring sites with the potential for online harm. ACPE had been involved with work on Coco for years, with Antoine training people on how to use the site for research purposes while alerting authorities to illicit and dangerous activity there. In Pelicot’s case, he used an anonymous pseudonym on Coco and solicited men on a forum called “à son insu”, meaning “without her knowledge”, to come to his house in the small town of Mazan. Pelicot claimed on the forum that he and his wife shared a fetish for men having sex with her while she was asleep, not openly mentioning that he was drugging her against her will and that she had no knowledge or consent of his abuse. While many of the men claimed they believed they were engaging in a consensual sexual roleplay, investigators found that several times Pelicot also explicitly used the words “rape” and described drugging his wife to potential attackers. Coco was unmoderated to the extent that Pelicot was able to use the forum for years without any penalty, and authorities ultimately only became aware of him after a grocery store security guard caught Pelicot attempting to take nonconsensual videos of women who were shopping in 2020. In the unlikely event that a user did get kicked off Coco due to complaints or legal threats, researchers and authorities say the site would charge a small fee of about €10 to reinstate banned accounts. Despite the site becoming a well-known haven for online abuses, rights groups and authorities faced various legal hurdles in investigating and taking legal action against it. European Union regulations for years had broad provisions that prevented a website owner from being held legally liable for the content on their site, similar toSection 230 law in the US. Coco also moved where it was hosted, complicating matters by moving from being a wholly French site to a domain registered to the self-governing island of Guernsey under a .gg URL. Holding Steidl accountable for the site he created also faced another logistical hurdle – at some point after founding the site, he moved to Bulgaria, outside the immediate reach of French authorities, and renounced his French citizenship. Even as Coco was publicly implicated in a string of violence and sexual abuse, the site remained online, with Steidl nowhere to be found. While Pelicot was using Coco to perpetrate his attacks, a slew of other abuses were taking place in forums and chats throughout the site. For years, a number of high-profile crimes involving Coco received widespread news coverage inFranceand increased calls among rights groups to shut the platform down. One of earliest cases was the 2018 killing of 55-year-old Michel Sollossi, who was killed by a 22-year-old man who had arranged to meet up with him on Coco. Sollossi was found beaten to death in his home in the Paris suburbs, with a trial finding that the killing was a homophobic attack. The perpetrator was sentenced to 20 years in prison. A wave of similar “ambush attacks” on gay men who were lured to meet up with strangers on Coco followed. In 2022, a 24-year-old from Marseille alleged that he narrowly escaped an attack by three people who tried to run him over with their car when he arrived at a meetup arranged through Coco. Law enforcement officials arrested four people in the town of Saint-Polois earlier this year after they were accused of posing as men looking for hookups on the site then luring victims to meet them before violently attacking and robbing them. While violent attacks ambushing gay men proliferated on the platform, the site was also used for child sexual abuse. A man from the north-western French city of Brestadmitted in 2019to exchanging videos of child rape using the same “without her knowledge” forum as Pelicot. In one of the most high-profile cases, the 77-year-old former French pop star Richard Dewitte was arrested after sexually soliciting an undercover officer whom he believed was a 13-year-old girl. A court sentenced Dewitte tothree years in prisonlast year. Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion In yet another case, two teenage boys werearrested earlier this yearand charged with the killing of a 22-year-old man in a suburb of Dunkirk. The two boys allegedly pretended to be a girl looking to meet up on Coco, before ambushing the man and beating him to death in a parking lot when he showed up. The myriad of cases drew the attention of French LGBTQ+ rights groups such as SOS Homophobie and child protection organizations such as ACPE, which began calling for authorities to take more aggressive action against the site. “We have been talking about it for years and asking for it to be closed,” Antoine said. “But it was complicated with all the different European laws.” Coco’s ability to evade authorities relied on a combination of legal protections for internet providers, the complicated logistics of international investigations and obscured origins. Sites seeking to avoid scrutiny use a variety of tools to mask exactly where they are operating, forcing law enforcement to peel back layers of obfuscations before finding the origins and owners of a site. When authorities finally came for Coco, it involved an immense, 18-month international effort and a recent change in French law. In December 2023, France’s national anti-organized crime authority Junalco launched an investigation into Coco that utilized a 2023 law called “délit d’administration de plateforme”, which can hold administrators liable for certain activities on their sites. The law allows authorities to accuse site founders of complicity in crimes such as their sites or apps being used for illicit transactions that fund gangs. Violations carry penalties of up to 10 years in jail as well as fines up to €500,000. Prosecutors used the same law to issue a preliminary charge against the billionaire Telegram CEO, Pavel Durov, following his arrest earlier this year. Durov’s arrestgained international attentionand prompted a debate over the extent to which governments should hold platforms accountable for illegal content. Along with Junalco, agencies from countries including Lithuania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany and the Netherlands coordinated an effort to bring Coco down in June of this year. International authorities shut down servers based in Germany, seized about €5.6m and froze several bank accounts related to the site. In Bulgaria, local authorities arrested and interviewed Steidl with French prosecutors present as observers. Three of Steidl’s associates including his wife were also detained for questioning in France and later released,accordingto national media and a Junalco press release. French prosecutors have not issued statements on what the next steps in the criminal case involving Coco and Steidl may be, but the site remains offline. LGBTQ+ rights groups and anti-child abuse organizations have celebrated the closure while warning that similar sites may fill the vacuum. The Pelicot trial is meanwhile still ongoing as French society grapples with how such acts, committed by men from a variety of ages and backgrounds, could go undetected for so long. It’s a question that advocates against sexual abuse say involves the country reconsidering how these crimes happen, and who perpetrates them. “We are trying to dismantle the idea that these criminals are monsters,” Antoine said. “The Mazan case showed with websites like Coco these people can be your neighbors – even in the smallest town people can connect online and commit these crimes.” Kari Paul contributed reporting",Nick Robins-Early,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nick-robins-early,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/coco-website-pelicot-rape-trial
Could Aboriginal-designed housing help solve the health crisis in remote communities?,,"It’s hotter inside than out in many of the homes in the remoteNorthern Territorytown of Tennant Creek, where the Warumungu man Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla and his family live. Most lack insulation and guttering. At Drive-in Camp outside town, the homes are tin sheds, disconnected from services since the 2007 intervention but still occupied. The poor housing is making the residents sick, Jupurrurla says: “I worry about the future – will my grandchildren and their kids be living in prison-like houses? Or are we going to start designing homes that allow us to practise our culture?” A $1bn investment in remote housing in the NT since 2017 has failed to solve the problem. A further $4bn was pledged in March in a joint announcement by the federal and Territory governments. But health experts warn that unless authorities commit to a dramatic shift in the way housing is designed and built for Indigenous communities, public health outcomes could worsen. Poor housing has been blamed for high rates of rheumatic heart disease in the NT. The preventable condition is caused by repeated, untreated streptococcus A infections and is linked to poverty, overcrowded and inadequate housing and lack of access to healthcare. Australia has one of the highest rates of RHD in the world, and rates have doubled between 2012 and 2021. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Jupurrurla says community participation in decision-making leads to better maintenance and a sense of ownership. He is the chair of Wilya Janta, a cultural consultancy and housing collective based in Tennant Creek which has developed housing designs by Aboriginal people for Aboriginal people. “For too long, we’ve been given houses we had no say in designing,” he says. Simon Quilty, a GP based in Tennant Creek, also works with Wilya Janta. He says nothing symbolises the failure of government housing design more clearly than steel trapdoors. These were introduced about five years ago to accommodate future air conditioning installations. But instead of providing relief from the heat they act as conductors, turning homes into ovens. “If you can’t afford an aircon, then you’ll have a heat-conducting steel plate making you need that aircon even more than if you did have the money to buy one,” Quilty says. “It is madness, these design lunacies make houses more expensive to build and injure the wellbeing of the resident for no possible gain, to save a few measly bucks.” Glenn Platt, the executive director of strategy and innovation at Emergent Group, says the metal trapdoor is like “having an extra glass window in the room”. The result is a home which is hotter inside than out, a significant health risk when temperatures are frequently above 40C. Overcrowded and poorly ventilated housing is a major driver of preventable diseases among Aboriginal communities, with more than half of all Indigenous people in the NT living in overcrowded homes. Dr John Paterson, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT, says poor housing contributes to the spread of infectious diseases, hampers early childhood development, affects mental health, and diminishes social and emotional wellbeing. “Diseases like rheumatic heart disease are better termed diseases of poverty; driven by overcrowded housing, lack of access to washing facilities and palatable drinking water that is unfortunately too common in remote communities, particularly in the central region,” he says. Overcrowded environments increase the chances of repeated exposure to streptococcus bacteria. While harmless on the skin’s surface or easily managed by antibiotics in communities with good access to health services, repeat infections can lead to immune reactions that scar heart valves. “We’re asking for the same basic human rights which include the same building standards, the same building repair and maintenance expectations, the same basic functions of a house – like access to suitable drinking water and a continuous power supply – that people living in any other jurisdiction in Australia take for granted,” Paterson says. “But for too long these standards have not been met in remote communities.” Most government-built homes in remote areas are built using concrete blocks. They have inadequate thermal efficiency, poor ventilation and minimal climate control. The new housing funding will pay for up to 2,700 new three-bedroom homes over 10 years. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese,said the program was designed to halve overcrowding in Indigenous communities in the NTas part of the Closing the Gap goals. Some 971 new or replacement homes have been built and 489 expanded under other funding deals since 2017. A federal Department ofHousingspokesperson said the new builds would be constructed after consultation with Indigenous communities and Aboriginal Housing NT. Skye Thompson, AHNT’s chief executive, told Guardian Australia that the new homes must be appropriate for the climate and culture of those living in them. “When houses are built to a lower standard of energy efficiency and works are not subject to a proper certification process; when they are poorly oriented, too hot or stuffy; and when the design doesn’t suit the residents’ family configuration or culture, the return on investment nosedives,” she says. The NT minister for housing construction, Bill Yan, said the new Country Liberal party government, whichswept to victory in Auguston a platform that included reversing youth justice reforms andlowering the age of criminal responsibility to 10, reaffirmed the NT government’s commitment to the $4bn housing partnership with the federal government. “The partnership with the federal government is a signed agreement that the new government will honour,” he said. “Territorians living in safe housing is an important part to community safety as well as enjoying our Territory lifestyle,. “We will listen to stakeholders and communities on their housing needs and consider expert advice on any issues prohibiting effective and efficient delivery of remote housing.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter",Otis Filley,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/otis-filley,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/could-aboriginal-designed-housing-help-solve-the-health-crisis-in-remote-communities
Woman who did not get leaving card loses UK employment claim,,"A woman who sued her former employer over not being given a leaving card lost her case when it was revealed it had been hidden from her after only three people signed it. Karen Conaghan claimed that the “failure to acknowledge her existence” at IAG, the parent company ofBritish Airways, was a breach of equality law. However, a former colleague told an employment tribunal that managers had indeed bought a card but did not present it to Conaghan because of the low number of signatures,the Timesreported. The judge, Kevin Palmer, said: “He believed it would have been more insulting to give her the card than not to give her a card at all.” The tribunal was told that two men also laid off during “restructuring” at the company, which also owns airlines Aer Lingus and Iberia, did not receive leaving cards either. Conaghan, a former business liaison lead, brought 40 complaints against the company for sexual harassment, victimisation and unfair dismissal. But the tribunaldismissed every claim, with Palmer concluding that Conaghan, who started working at the company in 2019, had adopted a “conspiracy-theory mentality”, mistaking “normal workplace interactions” for harassment. In one claim, she said a colleague had copied her use of the word “whiz” in a card for a colleague, but corrected her spelling by writing “whizz” instead. She said another employee had asked her: “Are you taking the piss, Karen?” The tribunal heard that this was after Conaghan suggested she had “done all of the hard work” and it was his “turn to do some”. Conaghan moved to Richmond, North Yorkshire, in September 2021 despite it being expected that all employees live within two hours of the office in Heathrow, the tribunal heard. She was made redundant in the same year as part of a restructuring of the organisation, with colleagues saying in evidence that many people also left around the same time. Judge Palmer said that although further signatures were gathered on the leaving card after her departure, a former colleague took the view that “it was inappropriate to send such a card to [her] at a later date as she had raised a grievance against him and [another colleague]”. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Many of the acts cited in the claim “either did not happen or, if they did happen, they were innocuous interactions in the normal course of employment”, the judge ruled. He said that there was no evidence to suggest that any of Conaghan’s allegations were in any way related to her sex and that one of the allegations was indicative of her “view of normal interactions being something more sinister”. In another, unrelated case earlier this year, an employment tribunal judge ruled that sending an employee an unwanted birthday card could amount to “unwanted conduct” and harassment.",Tom Ambrose,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-ambrose,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/12/woman-leaving-card-employment-claim-tribunal
Carsley is not the problem – something feels rotten at the core of this England,,"There is perhaps a certain bitter comic timing in the fact that England’s next opponent is the country serially ranked as the happiest on earth. Prosperous, equal, well-educated, socially supported and with few delusions of global grandeur,Finlandoffers our own disgruntled and perennially troubled nation an abundance of useful life lessons, most of which you can guarantee will go unheeded. And so to Helsinki, where Lee Carsley apparently has only three games left to save the job that was apparently his after two games, slipping away after three games, and which hedoes not actually appear to wantanyway. Perhaps it was inevitable, given our evident lack of enthusiasm for the Nations League format in general, that English football would use this autumn lacuna as an opportunity to turn entirely in upon itself, to give full rein to its rolling psychodrama, an extended Lee In/Lee Out referendum campaign. The first point to make is that for all the histrionic headlines that greetedThursday night’s Wembley debacle, Ivan Jovanovic’s Greece side are actually quite a bit better than a Fifa world ranking of 48 would have you assume. This was, after all, a team that had been on a sharp upward curve for a while:drawing with Franceand outplaying Germany for large parts of a 2-1 friendly defeat just before the Euros. According to the Elo ratings – a rolling and slightly more rigorous long-term measure of international performance – their triumph at Wembley actually lifted them into the world’s top 20, ahead of the likes of the United States, Mexico, Sweden and Morocco. The same system actually rates the current Greece as a better side than they were at the start of Euro 2004, a tournament they famously won. Obviously you still expectEnglandto beat them. On the pure measure of expected goals – 0.84 to 0.74 in England’s favour – this was not quite the spanking it felt like in real time, perhaps as a result of Greece’s three disallowed goals. But maybe this is a team actually worth according a certain respect, rather than a litany of bad puns and a team selection that reeked of imperial contempt. Which brings us to a second, possibly counterintuitive point: England’s system on Thursday night was not so much a case of poor conception as poor execution. Throwing together all the good attacking players – with a plan, with proper drilling, with pressing and purpose and intensity and a grasp of the small details – this can actually work. You defend high and as a unit, pin the opposition into their own territory, starve them of the ball, suffocate them, and then cut them to pieces with creativity. But, of course, this is a tactic that requires more than 20 minutes of practice. Clearly Carsley will get the bullets for this, and fair enough; it was a terrible display, explained terribly. But what was striking about England’s performance against Greece was not simply the incoherence but the lack of vigour and commitment. Pulling out of tackles. Allowing Greek players to dribble into dangerous areas with impunity. A lack of pressure on the man in possession. Given the way England approached that game, there is arguably no system in the world that would have won it for them. That may also be on Carsley, but it is not purely a system issue, and it certainly goes back further than this autumn. Take a longer view and the Greece game was simply part of a wider pattern of staid, inchoate, borderline-illegible England performances in the past 12 months. Something feels rotten at the core of this squad, and in this context Thursday’s abortive celebrity extravaganza felt more like a logical progression than some wild anomaly. You can see it in the positional indiscipline, a habit that surfaced during Euro 2024, like a surreal episode of Oprah. Harry Kane, you get to be No 10! Jude Bellingham, you get to be No 10! Phil Foden, you get to be No 10! You can see it in the insipid and erratic pressing, the unmodulated effort, the idea that tracking and covering is somebody else’s job. You can see it in the body language, which turns negative suspiciously quickly. And you could see it in Carsley’s selection, which felt like an attempt to keep all the stars happy, a sop to the officer corps, Roberto Martínez with even less authority. Already there has been a slight but clear deference to the biggest clubs. Levi Colwill and Noni Madueke get fast-tracked while Eberechi Eze and Jarrod Bowen are sidelined. An undercooked Foden plays ahead of Ollie Watkins. Jack Grealish comes straight back in while James Maddison has to wait. Angel Gomes plays 90 good minutes against Finland and then no minutes against Greece. There are, of course, long-term trends at work here. The squad Gareth Southgate took to Russia in 2018 had a grand total of one Champions League medal (belonging to Gary Cahill) and 11 Premier League titles between them. The current squad has eight Champions Leagues and 27 league titles (one in Spain). Higher standards; but also greater expectations, bigger egos, a subtly different calculus of where international football sits in their legacy. For years the focus of England’s cultural development has been on how we can keep these guys happy, in an era where the rewards and prestige are ever more severely weighted towards club football. This was one of Southgate’s great achievements, and by the end even he seemed a little lost in the cosmos, desperately trying to keep the circus on the road, a cast of stars all convinced they were possessed of some unique main-character energy. When it works, your stars step up at crucial moments to drag you to a major final you had no business being in. But the problem with this model is that effort becomes contingent on circumstances. Euro semi-final: fine. UefaNations Leaguegroup B2 in October: good luck with that. Which is why a certain arrogance, a certain caprice, seems to have crept into the setup. There is an old Finnish proverb:onnellisuus on se paikka puuttuvaisuuden ja yltäkylläisyyden välillä, which means “happiness is a place between scarcity and abundance”. For the last few years English football has enjoyed an abundance of talent and a scarcity of identity. What they really need is a 2016-style cultural reboot, not the sad late-era Southgate but the insurgent early Southgate. A coach who could reassert control, slay a few sacred cows, reconnect the reality of playing for England with the idea of playing for England, imbue a sense of mission and purpose that goes beyond simply wanting to win something. Most probably Carsley is not that guy. But then, who is? A big foreign coach such as Thomas Tuchel may deliver the required authority, but not the sense of meaning or the cultural change. Eddie Howe, Graham Potter, Steve Cooper: all good and all flawed in their various ways. The coach England need right now may not exist. There is a reason they called it the impossible job.",Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-liew,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2024/oct/12/england-lee-carsley-not-problem-something-feels-rotten-at-core-nations-league
Body parts in freezer left at Colorado home spark homicide investigation,,"Body parts found in a freezer that was left behind at aColoradohome that was sold are of a 16-year-old girl who went missing in 2005, authorities have said. The death of Amanda Leariel Overstreet – the biological daughter of the home’s previous owner – is being investigated as a homicide, according to the sheriff’s office overseeing the case. An investigation into Overstreet’s slaying remains ongoing. The discovery of Overstreet’s remains was made in January, after the new owner of a house near Grand Junction gave away a freezer left behind by the previous occupant. The person who claimed the freezer found a human head and forearms with hands attached,saidthe Mesa county sheriff’s office. Overstreet’s body parts were identified through DNA testing. She had not been seen since April 2005, and “there is no record that Amanda Overstreet was ever reported missing”, a statement from the sheriff read. An exact cause of death has not yet been determined, and no arrests have been made. The missing girl lived in the Grand Junction and Harris county, Texas, areas, according to the Mesa county coroner’s office. The new owner of the home was “completely unrelated to the previous case”, said the sheriff’s office. “The house was purchased, fully remodeled, and sold to the current owner.” According toColorado Public Radio, records show a home on the street where Overstreet’s remains were discovered belonged to a Bradley David Imer, who died of Covid-19 in 2021. The outlet said Imer’s death certificate lists his spouse as Leanne Overstreet. Colorado Public Radio noted that it had been unable to determine whether Leanne Overstreet and Amanda Overstreet were related. But the sheriff’s office did confirm to the outlet that Amanda’s biological mother had been a previous owner of the home where the remains were found. Meanwhile, the Mesa county sheriff’s office provided a statement to theDaily Mailconfirming Leanne Overstreet had indeed owned the home where her daughter’s remains were found.",Oliver Milman,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/oliver-milman,,most-viewed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/colorado-freezer-body-part-homicide-investigation
